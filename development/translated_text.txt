speak nephew when began



benvolio

here the servants your adversary

and yours close fighting before did approach

drew part them the instant came

the fiery tybalt sword prepar’d

which breath’d defiance my ears

swung about head and cut the winds

who nothing hurt withal hiss’d him scorn

while interchanging thrusts and blows

came more and more and fought part and part

till the prince came who parted either part



lady montague

o where romeo saw him today

right glad am fray



benvolio

madam hour before the worshipp’d sun

peer’d forth the golden window the east

troubled mind drave me walk abroad

where underneath the grove sycamore

westward rooteth city side

so early walking did see your son

towards him made ware me

and stole into the covert the wood

measuring affections my own

which then most sought where most might found

being too many my weary self

pursu’d my humour pursuing

and gladly shunn’d who gladly fled me



montague

many morning has there been seen

tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew

adding clouds more clouds deep sighs

so soon the allcheering sun

should the farthest east begin near

the shady curtains aurora’s bed

away light steals home my sad son

and private chamber pens himself

shuts up windows locks fair daylight out

and makes himself artificial night

black and portentous must humour prove

unless good counsel may the cause remove



benvolio

my noble uncle do know the cause



montague

neither know nor learn him



benvolio

importun’d him any means



montague

both myself and many other friends

own affections’ counsellor

himself—i will say how true—

himself so secret and so close

so far sounding and discovery

the bud bit envious worm

before spread sweet leaves the air

dedicate beauty the sun

could learn from where sorrows grow

would willingly give cure know

romeo

mercutio

and so did



romeo

well yours



mercutio

dreamers often lie



romeo

bed asleep while do dream things true



mercutio

o then see queen mab has been

she the fairies’ midwife and she comes

shape no bigger than agatestone

the forefinger alderman

drawn team little atomies

over men’s noses lie asleep

waggonspokes made long spinners’ legs

the cover the wings grasshoppers

traces the smallest spider’s web

the collars the moonshine’s watery beams

whip cricket’s bone the lash film

waggoner small greycoated gnat

half so big round little worm

prick’d the lazy finger maid

chariot empty hazelnut

made the joiner squirrel old grub

time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers

and state she gallops night night

through lovers’ brains and then dream love

over courtiers’ knees dream curtsies straight

over lawyers’ fingers who straight dream fees

over ladies’ lips who straight kisses dream

which often the angry mab blisters plagues

because their breaths sweetmeats tainted are

sometime she gallops over courtier’s nose

and then dreams smelling out suit

and sometime comes she tithepig’s tail

tickling parson’s nose lies asleep

then dreams another benefice

sometime she driveth over soldier’s neck

and then dreams cutting foreign throats

breaches ambuscados spanish blades

healths five fathom deep and then soon

drums ear which starts and wakes

and being thus frighted swears prayer two

and sleeps again very mab

plats the manes horses the night

and bakes the elflocks foul sluttish hairs

which once untangled much misfortune bodes

the hag when maids lie their backs

presses them and learns them first bear

making them women good carriage

she—



romeo

peace peace mercutio peace

you talk’st nothing



mercutio

true talk dreams

which are the children idle brain

begot nothing vain fantasy

which thin substance the air

and more inconstant than the wind who woos

even now the frozen bosom the north

and being anger’d puffs away thence

turning side the dewdropping south



benvolio

wind talk blows us ourselves

supper done and shall come too late



romeo

frighten too early my mind misgives

some consequence yet hanging the stars

shall bitterly begin fearful date

night’s revels and expire the term

despised life clos’d my breast

some disgusting forfeit untimely death

has the steerage my course

direct my suit lusty gentlemen



benvolio

strike drum

scene ii capulet’s garden



enter romeo



romeo

jests scars never felt wound



juliet appears above window



soft light through over there window breaks

the east and juliet the sun

arise fair sun and kill the envious moon

who already sick and pale grief

you maid are far more fair than she

maid since she envious

vestal livery sick and green

and none fools do wear cast off

my lady o my love

o she knew she

she speaks yet she says nothing

eye discourses will answer

am too bold it is me she speaks

two the fairest stars the heaven

having some business do entreat eyes

twinkle their spheres till return

if eyes there head

the brightness cheek would shame those stars

daylight does lamp eyes heaven

would through the airy region stream so bright

birds would sing and think night

see how she leans cheek upon hand

o glove upon hand

might touch cheek



juliet

ay me



romeo

she speaks

o speak again bright angel you are

glorious night being over my head

winged messenger heaven

unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes

mortals fall back gaze him

when bestrides the lazypuffing clouds

and sails upon the bosom the air



juliet

o romeo romeo why are you romeo

deny your father and refuse your name

if you will sworn my love

and i’ll no longer capulet



romeo

aside shall hear more shall speak



juliet

it is your name my enemy

you are thyself though montague

what’s montague nor hand nor foot

nor arm nor face nor any other part

belonging man o some other name

what’s name which call rose

so romeo would romeo call’d

retain dear perfection which owes

without title romeo doff your name

romeo

juliet

how cam’st you to here tell me and why

the orchard walls are high and hard climb

and the place death considering who you are

if any my kinsmen find you here



romeo

love’s light wings did o’erperch these walls

stony limits cannot hold love out

and love do dares love attempt

therefore your kinsmen are no stop me



juliet

if do see you will murder you



romeo

alack there lies more peril yours eye

than twenty their swords look you sweet

and am proof against their enmity



juliet

would the world saw you here



romeo

night’s cloak hide me their eyes

and you love me let them find me here

my life better ended their hate

than death prorogued wanting your love



juliet

whose direction found’st you out place



romeo

love first did prompt me enquire

lent me counsel and lent him eyes

am no pilot yet were you far

vast shore wash’d the farthest sea

should adventure such merchandise



juliet

else would maiden blush bepaint my cheek

which you have heard me speak tonight

fain would dwell form fain fain deny

spoke farewell compliment

do you love me know you will say ay

and will enthrall your word yet if you swear’st

you may prove false lovers’ perjuries

say jove laughs o gentle romeo

if you do love pronounce faithfully

if you think am too quickly won

i’ll frown and perverse and say you no

so you will woo else the world

truth fair montague am too fond

and therefore you may think my ’haviour light

trust me gentleman i’ll prove more true

than those more clever strange

should been more strange must confess

you overheard’st before ’ware

my truelove passion therefore pardon me

and impute yielding light love

which the dark night has so discovered



romeo

lady over there blessed moon vow

tips silver these fruittree tops—



juliet

o swear the moon th’inconstant moon

monthly changes circled orb

lest your love prove likewise variable



romeo

shall swear



juliet

do swear

if you will swear your gracious self

which the god my idolatry

and i’ll believe you



romeo

if my heart’s dear love—



juliet

well do swear although joy you

no joy contract tonight

too rash too unadvis’d too sudden

too like the lightning which does cease

before say “it lightens” sweet good night

bud love summer’s ripening breath

may prove beauteous flower when next meet

good night good night sweet repose and rest

come your heart within my breast



romeo

o will you leave me so unsatisfied

friar lawrence

the greyey’d morn smiles the frowning night

chequering the eastern clouds streaks light

and fleckled darkness like drunkard reels

forth day’s pathway made titan’s fiery wheels

now before the sun advance burning eye

the day cheer and night’s dank dew dry

must upfill osier cage ours

baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers

the earth that’s nature’s mother tomb

burying bury womb

and womb children divers kind

sucking natural bosom find

many many virtues excellent

none some and yet different

o mickle the powerful grace lies

plants herbs stones and their true qualities

nothing so disgusting the earth does live

the earth some special good does give

nor aught so good strain’d fair use

revolts true birth stumbling abuse

virtue itself turns vice being misapplied

and vice sometime’s action dignified



enter romeo



within the infant rind weak flower

poison has residence and medicine power

being smelt part cheers each part

being tasted slays senses the heart

two such opposed kings encamp them always

man well herbs—grace and rude will

and where the worser predominant

full soon the canker death eats up plant



romeo

good morrow father



friar lawrence

benedicite

early tongue so sweet saluteth me

recent son argues distemper’d head

so soon bid good morrow your bed

care keeps watch every old man’s eye

and where care lodges sleep will never lie

where unbruised youth unstuff’d brain

does sleep limbs there golden sleep does reign

therefore your earliness does me assure

you are uprous’d some distemperature

if so then here hit right

our romeo has been bed tonight

romeo

where sudden has wounded me

that’s me wounded both our remedies

within your help and holy physic lies

bear no hatred blessed man lo

my intercession likewise steads my foe



friar lawrence

plain good son and homely your drift

riddling confession finds riddling admit



romeo

then plainly know my heart’s dear love set

the fair daughter rich capulet

mine hers so hers set mine

and combin’d save you must combine

holy marriage when and where and how

met woo’d and made exchange vow

i’ll tell you pass pray

you consent indeed us today



friar lawrence

holy saint francis change here

rosaline you didst love so dear

so soon forsaken recent men’s love then lies

truly their hearts their eyes

jesu maria deal brine

has wash’d your sallow cheeks rosaline

how much salt water thrown away waste

season love does taste

the sun yet your sighs heaven clears

your old groans yet ring mine ancient ears

lo here upon your cheek the stain does sit

old tear wash’d off yet

if before you were thyself and these woes yours

you and these woes rosaline

and are you chang’d pronounce sentence then

women may fall when there’s no strength men



romeo

you chidd’st me often loving rosaline



friar lawrence

doting loving pupil mine



romeo

and bad’st me bury love



friar lawrence

o cousin cousin



prince

benvolio who began bloody fray



benvolio

tybalt here slain whom romeo’s hand did slay

romeo spoke him fair bid him bethink

how nice the quarrel and urg’d withal

your high displeasure uttered

gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow’d

could enthrall truce the unruly spleen

tybalt deaf peace tilts

piercing steel bold mercutio’s breast

who hot turns deadly point point

and martial scorn hand beats

cold death aside and the other sends

back tybalt whose dexterity

retorts romeo cries aloud

‘hold friends friends part’ and swifter than tongue

agile arm beats down their fatal points

and ’twixt them rushes underneath whose arm

envious thrust tybalt hit the life

stout mercutio and then tybalt fled

and comes back romeo

who newly entertain’d revenge

and to’t go like lightning before

could near part them stout tybalt slain

and fell did romeo turn and fly

the truth let benvolio die



lady capulet

kinsman the montague

affection makes him false speaks true

some twenty them fought black strife

and those twenty could kill life

beg justice which you prince must give

romeo slew tybalt romeo must live



prince

romeo slew him slew mercutio

who now the price dear blood does owe



montague

romeo prince mercutio’s friend

fault concludes the law should end

the life tybalt



prince

and offence

immediately do exile him from here

interest your hate’s proceeding

my blood your rude brawls does lie ableeding

i’ll amerce so strong fine

shall repent the loss mine

will deaf pleading and excuses

nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses

therefore use none let romeo from here haste

else when found hour last

bear from here body and attend our will

mercy murders pardoning those kill

scene ii room capulet’s house

juliet

gallop apace fieryfooted steeds

towards phoebus’ lodging such waggoner

phaeton would whip the west

and bring cloudy night immediately

spread your close curtain loveperforming night

runaway’s eyes may wink and romeo

leap these arms untalk’d and unseen

lovers see do their amorous rites

their own beauties if love blind

best agrees night come civil night

you sobersuited matron black

and learn me how lose winning match

play’d pair stainless maidenhoods

hood my unmann’d blood bating my cheeks

your black mantle till strange love grow bold

think true love acted simple modesty

come night come romeo come you day night

you will lie upon the wings night

whiter than new snow upon raven’s back

come gentle night come loving blackbrow’d night

give me my romeo and when shall die

enthrall him and cut him out little stars

and will make the face heaven so fine

the world will love night

and pay no worship the garish sun

o bought the mansion love

possess’d and though am sold

yet enjoy’d so tedious day

the night before some festival

impatient child has new robes

and may wear them o here comes my nurse

and she brings news and every tongue speaks

romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence



enter nurse cords



now nurse news have you there

the cords romeo bid you fetch



nurse

ay ay the cords



throws them down

those eyes shut make you answer ay

if slain say ay if no

brief sounds determine my weal woe



nurse

saw the wound saw mine eyes

god save the mark—here manly breast

piteous corse bloody piteous corse

pale pale ashes bedaub’d blood

goreblood swounded the sight



juliet

o break my heart poor bankrout break once

prison eyes ne’er look liberty

disgusting earth earth resign end motion here

and you and romeo press sad bier



nurse

o tybalt tybalt the best friend

o courteous tybalt pure gentleman

ever should live see you dead



juliet

storm blows so contrary

romeo slaughter’d and tybalt dead

my dearest cousin and my dearer lord

then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom

who living if those two are gone



nurse

tybalt gone and romeo banished

romeo kill’d him banished



juliet

o god did romeo’s hand shed tybalt’s blood



nurse

did did alas the day did



juliet

o serpent heart hid flowering face

did ever dragon keep so fair cave

beautiful tyrant fiend angelical

dovefeather’d raven wolvishravening lamb

despised substance divinest show

just opposite you justly seem’st

damned saint honourable villain

o nature hadst you do hell

when you didst bower the spirit fiend

mortal paradise such sweet flesh

ever book containing such disgusting matter

so fairly bound o deceit should dwell

such gorgeous palace



nurse

there’s no trust

no faith no honesty men perjur’d

forsworn nothing dissemblers

ah where’s my man give me some aqua vitae

these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old

shame come romeo



juliet

such wish born shame

upon brow shame asham’d sit

it is throne where honour may crown’d

sole monarch the universal earth

o beast chide him



nurse

will speak well him kill’d your cousin



juliet

shall speak ill him my husband

ah poor my lord tongue shall smooth your name

when your threehours’ wife mangled

why villain didst you kill my cousin

villain cousin would kill’d my husband

back foolish tears back your native spring

your tributary drops belong woe

which mistaking offer up joy

my husband lives tybalt would slain

and tybalt’s dead would slain my husband

comfort why weep then

some word there worser than tybalt’s death

murder’d me would forget fain

o presses my memory

like damned guilty deeds sinners’ minds

tybalt dead and romeo banished

‘banished’ word ‘banished’

has slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt’s death

woe enough if ended there

if sour woe delights fellowship

and needly will rank’d other griefs

why follow’d when she said tybalt’s dead

your father your mother no both

which modern lamentation might mov’d

rearward following tybalt’s death

‘romeo banished’—to speak word

father mother tybalt romeo juliet

slain dead romeo banished

there no end no limit measure bound

word’s death no words woe sound

where my father and my mother nurse



nurse

weeping and wailing over tybalt’s corse

will go them will bring to there



juliet

wash wounds tears mine shall spent

when theirs are dry romeo’s banishment

enthrall up those cords poor ropes are beguil’d

where juliet lives and every cat and dog

and little mouse every unworthy thing

live here heaven and may look

the white wonder dear juliet’s hand

and steal immortal blessing lips

who even pure and vestal modesty

always blush thinking their own kisses sin

romeo may banished

may flies do when must fly

are free men am banished

and say’st you yet exile death

hadst you no poison mix’d no sharpground knife

no sudden mean death though ne’er so mean

banished kill me banished

killing love which you have vow’d cherish

your wit ornament shape and love

misshapen the conduct them both

like powder skilless soldier’s flask

set afire yours own ignorance

and you dismember’d yours own defence

rouse you man your juliet alive

whose dear sake you were lately dead

there are you happy tybalt would kill you

you slew’st tybalt there are you happy

the law threaten’d death becomes your friend

and turns exile there are you happy

pack blessings light upon your back

happiness courts you best array

like misshaped and sullen wench

you putt’st up your fortune and your love

enthrall heed enthrall heed such die miserable

go get you your love decreed

ascend chamber from here and comfort

look you stay till the watch set

then you can pass mantua

where you shall live till find time

blaze your marriage reconcile your friends

beg pardon the prince and call you back

twenty hundred thousand times more joy

than you went’st forth lamentation

go before nurse commend me your lady

which sad sorrow makes them apt unto

romeo coming

shall keep native progress surcease

no warmth no breath shall testify you livest

the roses your lips and cheeks shall fade

paly ashes your eyes’ windows fall

like death when shuts up the day life

each part depriv’d supple government

shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death

and borrow’d likeness shrunk death

you shall continue two and forty hours

and then awake pleasant sleep

now when the bridegroom the morning comes

rouse you your bed there are you dead

then the manner our country

your best robes uncover’d the bier

you shall borne same ancient vault

where the kindred the capulets lie

the meantime against you shall awake

shall romeo my letters know our drift

and to here shall come and and

will watch your waking and very night

shall romeo bear you from here mantua

and shall free you present shame

if no inconstant toy nor womanish frighten

abate your valour the acting
