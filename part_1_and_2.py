### This is a Semi Game Teardown of the Game Pokemon Go ###

    ## Goal: To find the top x prevalent glitch/bugs in the game: Pokemon Go.
    ## Methodology: 
        # Generating list of the various glitches & bugs encounter by users, throughout the history of the game's existence. 
        # Then browse select sections of the broad Pokemon Go Wikipedia Page, to gather which are the most noticeable glitch/bugs, based on the fuzz score.
