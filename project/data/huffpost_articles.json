    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nThe Pentagon’s inspector general, Steven Stebbins, said late last week that he will open an investigation into “Signalgate,” the portmanteau for the scandal created last month when a team of high-ranking Trump officials used the commercial messaging app Signal to discuss real-time war plans, in what amounted to a massive breach of security.\n\nThe investigation will focus on Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s use of the app, rather than secure government channels, to discuss detailed information about a military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen and whether doing so was in line with Department of Defense policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements,” the announcement reads.\n\nIt’s the first indication of any kind of potential administration repercussions for the dozen or so Cabinet officials and surrogates who were involved in the chat. In fact, the messaging so far has been largely the opposite: The White House has attempted to paper over the severity of the bombshell revelation, even though President Donald Trump and his administration have long claimed to have no tolerance for anything that could jeopardize national security.\n\nThe scandal was revealed when Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, published a March 24 article in which he said he had been added to a chat on the messaging app Signal that involved 18 high-ranking administration officials, including Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz. The group chat included details about an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen that has since been carried out, including times, types of aircraft, and targets. The Atlantic reported that the National Security Council authenticated the text chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the messages were set to automatically delete one to four weeks after they were sent, a function that must be manually turned on by the creator of the chat, even though the Federal Records Act requires officials to preserve their communications.\n\nIt was an objectively stunning leak. But the White House raced to downplay the report.\n\nTrump has said Waltz, who added Goldberg to the Signal group, “learned a lesson.” Waltz himself echoed the idea that there had been “lessons learned” when he appeared on Fox News, and admitted: “We made a mistake.” He also said, “We’re not going to use Signal anymore.” (Politico reported last week that there are at least 20 Signal chats that officials use to discuss sensitive foreign policy work.)\n\nOfficials have painted the whole incident as a somewhat unremarkable error, with several brushing off what it meant that information about a military operation had been shared in the venue and delving into the semantics of whether it was classified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and his allies in the Republican Party are known for loudly clamoring for probes — and punishment — when it comes to the handling, or alleged mishandling, of sensitive information by their perceived enemies. In 2016, a cornerstone of Trump’s presidential campaign was going after opponent Hillary Clinton for her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. (The FBI investigated her, and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.)\n\nMore recently, just 10 days before Goldberg published his report, Gabbard devoted an entire thread on X (formerly Twitter) to the need to stop leaks that can compromise national security. She specifically lamented leaks that come from “within” the intelligence community.\n\nEven if the information in the chat was not technically classified, some experts told HuffPost that does not change how risky the conversation was: Sensitive details about a strike that had yet to occur were shared on a messaging platform that could have been infiltrated by political adversaries or hackers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt remains to be seen what, if any, punishment those involved in “Signalgate” may face. But legal experts and former members of the military said the U.S. has a long history of unequal punishments when it comes to security breaches and information leaks — and high-ranking officials are actually the ones who are most likely to avoid reprimand.\n\n‘Need-To-Know’\n\nIt’s unclear how much appetite there actually is for consequences, or even answers, within the administration.\n\nPreviously, FBI Director Kash Patel declined comment to Congress when asked if he would open a probe into the incident, and Attorney General Pam Bondi expressed scant interest in pursuing an investigation. During a press conference at the Justice Department, she instead offered commentary about Clinton, former President Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. (Both Clinton and Joe Biden came under investigation for their handling of classified documents, but were never charged.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the administration is not the only channel by which the public can get answers.\n\nThe public watchdog group American Oversight is suing the administration, alleging violations of the Federal Records Act. The group says the Signal chat amounted to a secret back channel, and the judge overseeing the lawsuit has ordered the Defense Department to preserve all records as the case plays out in Washington, D.C. A status hearing in federal court is slated for this week. American Oversight also filed Freedom of Information Act requests for information on Signal usage at 25 federal agencies.\n\nThe lawsuit over the text leak focuses on retention and transparency. But Liz Hempowicz, deputy executive director of American Oversight, said the whole ordeal also appears to be a “textbook case of what the Espionage Act was written to prevent.”\n\nThe Espionage Act makes unauthorized retention or distribution of sensitive information illegal and is punishable by fines and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Critically, the prosecution of those charges does not depend on whether the information that is disclosed is classified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If a junior enlisted service member had leaked strike plans to unauthorized recipients, they’d already be in custody,” Hempowicz said. “But when it’s a Cabinet official, the White House shrugs — and history suggests that will be the end of it.”\n\nAlaina Kupec, a retired U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer with experience planning strategic missions in Yemen and Iran, said her time in the military taught her that the type of information Hegseth disclosed is generally only shared on a strict “need-to-know basis” in order to protect the mission. Not everyone on the Signal chat, especially aides (not to mention Goldberg, who apparently no one realized was in the group), would need to know the precise timing of strikes, she said.\n\nHegseth and Waltz have defended the use of Signal for their group discussion, citing a need to move quickly. Typically, classified or sensitive information is disclosed in what is known as a SCIF, or a sensitive compartmented information facility. SCIFs are rooms that are kept secure and private, often with some sort of guard or official who has assessed the space for outside surveillance. Communications are classified and then are passed through SCIF devices. Calls, including group calls, can be held on secured lines, and a secure email system is also available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Before planes take off, that circle should be closed as tightly as possible, whether it’s time-sensitive or not,” Kupec said. “There is a government system created for them to communicate on. … Even if Signal is encrypted, there’s no system that isn’t plagued by eavesdropping concerns.”\n\nShe said the claim that officials were in a rush sounded like an excuse.\n\n“As I read the chat, at the end of the day, this was the secretary of defense showing off to his friends that he knew information and he wanted to look cool. That’s all that was, pure and simple. That was his first time dealing with something very sensitive and he was giddy and excited and sharing it with his friends,” Kupec said. “Like a child on a school ground having this secret he wanted to share with his friends. You just don’t share that level of information with that broad of an audience in an insecure way.”\n\nKupec said not everyone could act so carelessly without significant consequences.\n\n“Had that been me, as a junior officer who did that, my career would have been over and I would have been prosecuted. Without question,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘Different Spanks For Different Ranks’\n\nModern history has shown that there is indeed a disparity in how people at different levels are treated when they go against protocol or leak sensitive information.\n\nRetired Major General John Altenburg, the former designated senior ethics official for the Army and a former prosecutor with decades of experience in national security and oversight matters, said there are often “different spanks for different ranks” in the military.\n\nIn the case of Signalgate, he said he was “no apologist” for anyone involved in the chat. But a leaker’s intent can make a big difference in how they are prosecuted or punished, Altenburg told HuffPost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted that both Waltz and Hegseth have said that looping in Goldberg was an accident and an error, and therefore he doesn’t believe the Espionage Act — which does not differentiate between accidental and intentional leaks — should apply.\n\n“Once the strikes occurred, it was OBE, or overcome by events,” he said. In other words, once the strikes happened, any concern that Hegseth may have jeopardized national security or inadvertently exposed U.S. interests was a moot point.\n\nBut in other cases involving the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, even when disclosures were made well after the relevant missions were undertaken or military strategies were deployed, the federal government has extended stiff penalties. And while not every case of leaking can be compared one-to-one, it is notable, Hempowicz said, how often “high-ranking officials face minimal consequences, if any.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake, for example, the case of Daniel Hale, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence analyst who leaked top-secret documents to a journalist about America’s drone strike program in Afghanistan after he left the military in 2013.\n\nIt had been his job to track and coordinate drone killings of enemy combatants, but what he saw was the rampant, often indiscriminate killing of civilians caught in drone crosshairs. Hale’s attorneys said he leaked top-secret information out of altruism, not to boost his ego or glory.\n\nThe U.S. government didn’t see it that way. It charged Hale under the Espionage Act for disclosing information without authorization. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years in federal prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow consider James Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during President Barack Obama’s first term. Cartwright was accused of leaking top-secret information to reporters at Newsweek and The New York Times about a joint cyberwar attack mission being led by the U.S. and Israel against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Details about the operation ended up in a journalist’s book. The government said Cartwright lied to investigators when asked whether he had discussed classified details of the operation with another reporter. Emails showed that he had, prosecutors said, but after a lengthy investigation, he was never charged for disclosing information without authorization.\n\nBut he wasn’t charged under the Espionage Act. Instead, he was charged with making a false statement. He pleaded guilty to lying and insisted his “only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives.”\n\nCartwright remarked in 2016 after pleading guilty: “I love my country and continue to this day to do everything I can to defend it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors sought two years imprisonment for Cartwright. His defense attorneys asked for a year of probation plus community service. In 2017, Obama pardoned him before he could be formally sentenced.\n\nMeanwhile, former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning spent seven years in prison after she was convicted of sharing state and diplomatic cables with WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. Manning would have been in prison for 35 years, as prosecutors recommended, but her sentence was commuted in 2017. Assange was hit with over a dozen charges under the Espionage Act and pleaded guilty last year to receiving and publishing secrets. As part of his plea deal, he was allowed to return home to Australia without serving time in the U.S.\n\nContractors and analysts like Reality Winner and Henry Frese have been sent to prison for leaking sensitive information to the press. Winner, who leaked a top-secret report about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was sentenced to five years in prison but was released after two years on good behavior. Frese, once a civilian counterrorism consultant for the Pentagon, was sentenced to a little under three years in prison after he was convicted of sharing sensitive secrets about foreign weapons programs with reporters, one of whom was a girlfriend he was trying to impress, according to his lawyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlternatively, in the case of one high-ranking official, former CIA Director David Petraeus, Petraeus avoided Espionage Act charges altogether after he was investigated for disclosing classified information to his biographer, with whom he was also having an affair. Petraeus gave his biographer access to binders packed with sensitive and classified information including old military strategies and notes on discussions with the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround that same time, John Kiriakou, a former CIA counterterrorism officer who exposed the Bush administration’s torture program and revealed the name of a covert agent to a reporter, noted the double standard.\n\nHe had been charged under the Espionage Act and sentenced to just under three years.\n\n“Both Petraeus and I disclosed undercover identities — or confirmed one in my case — that were never published. I spent two years in prison; he gets two years’ probation,” Kiriakou told Vice in 2015.\n\nThis is the paradox that has always plagued the military, Kupec said.\n\n“There’s always a double standard for those that are in higher authority. They have the political connections and capacity to excuse themselves and wash away their sins. The White House considers this case closed on their part but this is why we have a separation of powers. [The White House] should not be the final arbiters of what’s legal or not,” she said."

Boasberg, the chief judge at the federal courthouse in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II to justify the deportation of hundreds of people under a presidential proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.\n\nAttorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan noncitizens who were being held in Texas, hours after the proclamation was made public and as immigration authorities were shepherding hundreds of migrants to waiting airplanes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoasberg imposed a temporary halt on deportations and also ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen. The judge held a hearing last week over whether the government defied his order to turn the planes around. The administration has invoked a “ state secrets privilege ” and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.\n\nTrump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Chief Justice John Roberts said “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nJamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, made a grim warning about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, saying they threaten to drive up prices in an already slowing economy and do long-term damage to America’s alliances.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, the head of Wall Street’s biggest bank said a recession is a serious possibility following the aggressive import taxes Trump slapped on China, the European Union and dozens of other countries whose products help keep U.S. consumer goods affordable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Dimon, one of the most influential figures in the financial services space, wrote. “And even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.”\n\nTrump may have some legitimate reasons to impose the tariffs, Dimon continued, but in “the short-term, we are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tariffs present potential retaliation from other countries, wrote Dimon, who said his “most serious concern is how this will affect America’s long-term economic alliances.”\n\n“America First is fine,” wrote Dimon, echoing one of Trump’s rallying cries, “as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone.”\n\nThese potential impacts on the economy would also drive up interest rates, he noted.\n\n“All of these cross currents and turbulence may take years to play out,” he said. “It is almost impossible to confidently put them into a quarterly or even annual forecast.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDimon’s letter comes a day after billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman issued a similar warning about the tariffs Trump announced last week, writing on social media that it’s akin to launching “economic nuclear war on every country in the world.” If Trump doesn’t pause the planned tariffs to allow for some negotiations over them, “we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down,” Ackman wrote.\n\n“[W]e are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” Ackman added.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

She was escorted away from the media as she exited, and her current condition was not made public, according to the West Australian newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack on March 31, Guiffre posted a picture from the hospital showing her injuries, which she said were caused when a school bus driver driving nearly 70 mph hit her vehicle as she was slowing for a turn.\n\nWhile in the hospital, she went into kidney renal failure, and said doctors gave her just days to live. She also accused Robert Giuffre, her husband of 22 years, of domestic abuse, according to People.\n\n“I was able to fight back against Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, who abused and trafficked me.

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nDaniel Penny, who last year was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely, appears to have no interest in retreating from public life.\n\nThe 26-year-old former Marine walked the runway Saturday at New York’s “Dressed to Kilt” fashion event, where he was introduced to the starry crowd as a “hero.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The next gentleman, the next model, can actually trace mention of his family back to the 12th century in Scotland,” charity co-founder Geoffrey Scott Carroll said of Penny in his introduction, according to the New York Post. “Having said that, he’s a very proud New Yorker and a very, very proud Marine.”\n\nHe went on to note: “Far from being a villain, this man was a hero to all the inhabitants of that subway car.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeely was homeless and struggling with schizophrenia in May 2023 when he frightened passengers on a New York subway car, prompting Penny, who is white, to restrain Neely, who is Black.\n\nPenny placed Neely in a six-minute chokehold, and later continued to restrict Neely’s neck for around a minute after he appeared to lose consciousness on the floor of the car. Neely was later pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nMuch of the altercation was caught on video by a bystander, and as a result, Neely’s death drew national attention and set off weeks of protests. A number of Republican lawmakers, however, defended Penny’s actions as that of a “good Samaritan.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA New York jury in December acquitted Penny of criminally negligent homicide in Neely’s death, shortly after a manslaughter charge — which would’ve carried a more significant penalty — was dismissed in deliberations.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News days after his trial ended, Penny said he “completely believed” Neely’s threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The guilt I would’ve felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,” he said.\n\nIn February, Penny was hired by Andreessen Horowitz, a blue-chip venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. He’s also remained a darling of conservatives, and in December was invited by then-Vice President-elect JD Vance to attend an Army-Navy football game as his guest.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe Justice Department argued in an emergency appeal to the justices that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.\n\nBut he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.\n\nXinis gave the administration until just before midnight to “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The district court’s injunction—which requires Abrego Garcia’s release from the custody of a foreign sovereign and return to the United States by midnight on Monday—is patently unlawful,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers, casting the order as one in “a deluge of unlawful injunctions” judges have issued to slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration is separately asking the Supreme Court to allow Trump to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to the same Salvadoran prison under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration’s request for a stay. “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in a brief opinion accompanying the unanimous denial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House has described Abrego Garcia’s deportation as an “administrative error” but has also cast him an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.\n\nXinis wrote that the decision to arrest him and send him to El Salvador appears to be “wholly lawless,” explaining that little to no evidence supports a “vague, uncorroborated” allegation that Abrego Garcia was once an MS-13 member.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn 2019, an immigration judge barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador."

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly planning on holding a 4-mile-long military parade on June 14 — his 79th birthday and the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary.\n\nThe Washington City Paper reported that the massive parade would flow from Arlington, Virginia, and into Washington, D.C. It is unclear whether the event would feature heavy military equipment, such as missile launchers or planes, as Trump once desired during his first term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parade logistics are reportedly still being hashed out but, according to Takis Karantonis, chair of the Arlington County Board in Virginia, the board received a “heads up” from the White House on Friday about the anticipated festivities.\n\nKarantonis told HuffPost in an emailed statement that neither the police nor fire department in Arlington County had received a formal request from the federal government for assistance with any military parade as of Friday.\n\n“Arlington is the proud home of tens of thousands of Veterans, active military and civilian personnel, and the Pentagon. We are a 9/11 community. U.S. Army history is Arlington history,” Karantonis said. “At this time, it is not clear to me what the scope of the parade would look be, but I would hope the Federal Government remains sensitive to the pain and concerns of numerous active military and veteran residents, who have lost or might lose their jobs in recent federal decisions, as they reflect on how best to celebrate the Army’s anniversary.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a press conference focused on local businesses in Washington on Monday, a reporter asked D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser whether the administration had contacted her about Trump’s parade.\n\nAt first, the mayor said, “I don’t know if it’s been characterized as a ‘military parade.’”\n\n“Maybe it has. I haven’t been directly involved in it yet. I think it was Homeland Security, maybe the White House, reached out to our special events task force, which is what most people wanting to do a parade do in the District,” she continued. “Yes, they have reached out. I don’t know if it’s being characterized as a ‘military parade.’”\n\nBut moments later, she acknowledged that if the parade starts at the Pentagon in Arlington and works its way into D.C., it would seem to be a “military parade.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has long wanted a showy display of military might to descend on the nation’s capital.\n\nAfter he won his first term, Trump wasted no time asking staff at the Pentagon to send him photos of military tactical vehicles he could use for his inaugural parade.\n\nEmails showed the Pentagon was hesitant to comply, citing concerns over exorbitant costs. In the end, he didn’t get his parade, but there was a 20-plane flyover.\n\nPentagon officials said in 2018 that the cost to put troops and tanks in the streets of Washington then was an estimated $92 million. That price tag did not account for the estimated $21.6 million in additional costs to the District of Columbia for merely hosting the event. (Trump had initially said the parade would cost just $12 million.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, Bowser said if tanks were used in June, it “wouldn’t be good” for D.C. streets but if the administration insisted, then the tanks “should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads.”\n\nA White House official said no military parade has been scheduled. It is unclear whether that means the White House is considering one.\n\nCol. Dave Butler, a spokesman for the U.S. Army, told HuffPost in an email Monday: “There hasn’t been a decision yet on whether or not we are having a parade. It is the Army’s intention to hold a national level event to build pride in America’s Army and America itself. June 14th will mark the Army’s 250th Birthday, we want America to celebrate with us.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, he was inspired to plan a parade after attending a Bastille Day event in Paris where France’s jets, tanks and other heavy military equipment were on display.\n\nFormer U.S. military officials noted then that extensive military parades, especially with tanks rolling down U.S. roads, are not really in the American “style.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nAfter a string of well-received performances in “13 Reasons Why” and “Jane the Virgin,” Tommy Dorfman was a star on the rise when she publicly reintroduced herself as a transgender woman in 2021. Behind the scenes, however, she says she grappled with the possibility that living as her true self would cut her acting career short, given the scarcity of opportunities for trans performers in Hollywood.\n\nFour years later, the Georgia-born actor is in the midst of a career resurgence after shifting her focus to the New York stage. Last fall, she made her Broadway debut alongside Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler in director Sam Gold’s production of “Romeo and Juliet,” breaking box office records. On Monday, she’ll tackle her most complex role to date when her new play, “Becoming Eve,” opens off-Broadway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I wasn’t sure I was still going to be acting after transitioning, even though I knew it was in my blood and in my spirit,” Dorfman said. “Now that I’m acting again, I’m insatiable. As a kid, all I wanted to do was theater, so having that dream realized made the times that were more challenging in the process insignificant. It’s given me an opportunity to reconnect with my voice and my body and my creativity.”\n\nDirected by Tyne Rafaeli and produced by New York Theatre Workshop, “Becoming Eve” is an adaptation of Abby Stein’s 2019 memoir of the same name. It follows Stein ― known globally as the first openly transgender female rabbi from a Hasidic background and an LGBTQ+ rights activist ― as she reflects on her upbringing in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclave in Brooklyn, New York, and, later, her marriage and rabbinical ordination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Becoming Eve” begins as Stein ― identified in the play by her middle name, Chava, and played by Dorfman ― is preparing to broach the subject of her gender identity with her stern father (Richard Schiff of “The West Wing”), also a rabbi and descendant of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidic Judaism.\n\nTo prepare for “Becoming Eve,” Dorfman and her cast mates ― including Tony winner Brandon Uranowitz and four-time Tony nominee Judy Kuhn ― met extensively with Stein, now a part-time rabbi at a progressive Brooklyn synagogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd though Dorfman rarely leaves the stage during the show, playwright Emil Weinstein incorporates life-sized puppets to portray younger iterations of Chava before her transition. It’s an effective and surprisingly poignant choice meant to “articulate this idea of a body and soul in mismatch,” Weinstein explains.\n\n“Part of what the play posits is this idea that we all contain multitudes within us, so there’s something beautiful about watching how hard it is for four people to operate a single body,” he said.\n\nThe off-Broadway premiere of “Becoming Eve” this week feels auspiciously timed, given President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights at the federal level. Though the production was originally slated for New York’s Connelly Theater, it was rejected by that building’s landlord, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, in October before landing at Abrons Arts Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I was really, really disappointed, even if I wasn’t exactly surprised,” Weinstein recalled. “It affirmed a lot of the fears we were feeling in the community as to where we were heading, which was disturbing and scary. But it also made everyone, especially on the producing side, even more passionate about doing the piece.”\n\nDescribing “Becoming Eve” as “inherently political in the way I think all good art is,” Dorfman added: “The politicization of trans people in this administration is inescapable, as are the complexities of being Jewish. My hope is that it cracks open some new ideas about peace, love and forgiveness for anybody who has the opportunity to see it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt present, “Becoming Eve” is scheduled to run at Abrons Arts Center through April 27. Exactly one month later, Dorfman will unveil her autobiography, “Maybe This Will Save Me: A Memoir of Art, Addiction and Transformation,” in which she chronicles her own path to self-acceptance.\n\nThough Dorfman is tight-lipped about what her next stage and screen projects may be, she says starring in “Becoming Eve” has already been a transformative experience.\n\nEnjoy HuffPost Entertainment — Ad Free\n\nWe're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

It really works and is so easy to use and convenient!.” — BRENDA C\n\n“So far I’m pleased with these. They are very easy to use, leave NO gunky mess in your mouth and are close to being tasteless. Some whiteners I’ve tried in the past caused tooth sensitivity pretty much right off the bat, were sticky and tasted terrible but not these pens. Directions say to use twice a day for seven days to achieve optimal results. I’m on day two and looking forward to seeing my teeth on day seven. I recommend giving them a try.” — Erika T.\n\n“Ok I gotta say that I never thought that these would work for the price they are but omg they totally do. I use it twice a day and have noticed a difference after a couple days. I’m a heavy coffee drinker and was starting to notice my teeth yellowing. I’m so impressed with these and have bought some for my sister and husband. It does not leave a coating on your teeth the rest of the day nor does it leave a gross flavor. It’s so easy to use too! If you’re thinking about it just buy it you’re not gonna regret it.” — Krista Wnuk"

    "text": "“I’m 71 years old and still want to look good, but I no longer want to wear all the make-up I used to. I tried a face balm made by Jones Road. Quite pricey, smells bad, but looks pretty good. Then while browsing thru Amazon I found this Bay Free face balm. It works like a dream! At a recent party, everyone wanted to know what I had done to look so good NATURALLY. I like this product way better than the Jones Road balm. It’s smoother, less expensive, and smells way better. You should try it.” — Judith McEwen\n\n“When looking at this, there was a blurb that said this was frequently returned, but yet it has so many good reviews. So I talked myself out of it. Came back a few days later and decided to do it as it’s way cheaper than jones road. I am so impressed. If I want to run someplace quick and don’t feel comfortable without some makeup, a little of this across the bridge of my nose and cheeks and what a difference! It’s really beautiful. Don’t sleep on this. I wish they had some without shimmer as you only need one shade. I don’t think you could use two Without looking too shimmery.” — Taylor\n\n“This balm is fantastic. Spreads easily and covers as advertised. I got some Jones Road and was frustrated with how thick and difficult to spread it was, even over moisturizer. Bayfree fixed those issues. I have the green primer, silk smoother, and dewy, still using the Jones Road I have as blush/toner, since I have 3 ounces of the clearly overpriced stuff. DO NOT USE SOMETHING MORE EXPENSIVE WITHOUT TRYING THIS. It’s absolutely amazing.” — Amy Wilson\n\n“I have 5 different colors of the JR Balm…they are sticky on your face, any longer hair that is flying around will stick to wherever you put Jones Road Balm. This Dusty Rose dup from BayFree is NOT sticky at all! Yet, all the other features are there: spread beautifully, sheer, staying power, delivers a glow, but NOT greasy and no glitter. For a third of the price, and a better match for my skin for everyday use,a dyomite dup! Highly recommend in place of Jones Road! Sorry, Bobbi Brown. I tried you first, and BayFree wins in the end.” — Janet Allen"

    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-easter-chocolate_l_67ed9f58e4b00a8085e3b775",
    "text": "Easter is second only to Halloween when it comes to chocolate-covered treats— just think of all the bunnies and eggs you see on store shelves. While some parts of the holiday were better as a kid (spending the morning hunting for candy), one thing I don’t miss is the disappointing taste of certain Easter chocolates. You know the ones — waxy, bland and weirdly crayon-like.\n\nAccording to Erica Gilmour, a chocolatier and founder of Hummingbird Chocolate in Almonte, Ontario, that chalky texture often comes from fillers like palm oil or soy lecithin, a sign that the brand you’ve chosen is cutting costs over creating a creamy, craveable confection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost spoke with experts about the three red flags that may make you reconsider when shopping for Easter chocolates. Here’s what they had to say.\n\n1. Physical Cues\n\nBefore you grab that chocolate bunny, take a second to give it a once-over. A little visual inspection can save you from biting into something disappointing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the chocolate is dull, soft or cloudy, it may indicate the chocolate is lower quality or not tempered correctly,” said Bill Brown, chief chocolate officer and owner of William Dean Chocolates in Florida. Instead, look for a shiny, almost glossy exterior — this indicates the chocolate has been properly tempered. Not only does it make for a more tempting-looking treat, but tempered chocolate has a smooth, silky texture when you bite it.\n\nWatch out for bright pink or red confections — Red dye No. 3 has been linked to health concerns. “One additive to be on high alert for this year in Easter chocolate is Red dye No. 3,” said Denise Castronovo, a chocolate maker and owner of Castronovo Chocolate in Florida. “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of Red dye No. 3, but food manufacturers have until January 2027 to remove it from their product.”\n\nIf you can get close enough to a bonbon or bar, give it a sniff. “Does it smell like chocolate?” asked Ron Sweetser, a cocoa sourcing and quality manager at Dandelion Chocolates in San Francisco. “It should! Not just sweet.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Ingredients To Avoid\n\nYou don’t need to be a food scientist to spot bad chocolate — just flip the package over.\n\n“High-quality chocolate has few ingredients [and] cacao (i.e. cocoa beans) is the most predominant one instead of sugar,” Castronovo said. “Dark chocolate only needs two ingredients: cacao and sugar.”\n\nThe same is true for milk or white chocolate. Castronovo explained, “High-quality milk chocolate has four ingredients: cacao, sugar, cocoa butter and milk. High-quality white chocolate should only be made with cocoa butter, sugar, milk and possibly real vanilla.”\n\nAll food products list ingredients in order of quantity, so if sugar or sweeteners come first, the chocolate likely has very little actual cacao. According to Gilmour, this makes for an easy tell: “If sugar or an alternative sweetener are the first or second ingredient, the chocolate does not have very much cacao in it and is low quality.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome mass-market chocolates contain ingredients you’d expect to find in a candle, not a candy bar. Cheap chocolate is often loaded with fillers like vanillin (a synthetic vanilla substitute), paraffin (a food-grade wax) and palm oil — ingredients that help manufacturers cut costs but don’t do your taste buds any favors.\n\nGilmour said, “Any type of palm oil or other oils (aside from cocoa butter) are being used as a cheap filler or alternative to real cocoa butter. This is a sign of a low-quality chocolate.”\n\n3. Suspiciously Low Price\n\nIf you’re scoring a deal and not shopping the after-Easter discount rack, you should be suspicious. While price doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get lower quality, with historically high cocoa prices, chocolate has also gotten more expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGilmour shared, “Although you can’t trust that chocolate is good quality because it’s expensive, you can be sure that very inexpensive chocolate is not good quality. So a low price is an immediate giveaway.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires. We Work For You.\n\nBig money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Laura Ingraham Leveled A Racial Trope At Jasmine Crockett, And It's 'Not Subtle'",
    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-fox-news-jasmine-crockett-racist-trope_n_67eedcd9e4b0d734a36dd96f",
    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham recently referred to Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) as “street” while criticizing the congresswoman’s remarks about Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nDuring a Wednesday segment of “The Ingraham Angle,” Ingraham and Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo each took jabs at the representative as they discussed her comments at a House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier that day, in which Crockett accused Bondi of attacking her right to free speech. (Bondi had previously told Crockett to “tread very carefully” when it comes to her criticisms of Elon Musk — and Crockett wasn’t having it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArroyo unabashedly labeled Crockett, who is Black, the “Madea of Capitol Hill” — seemingly a reference to filmmaker Tyler Perry’s famous boisterous Southern character, who is also Black. He also referred to Crockett as a “Desperate Housewife.”\n\nIngraham then said that the congresswoman had communicated in a “very different” way with her during a past interview.\n\n“And now she’s going very ... street,” Ingraham said as she swayed her head side-to-side. “I’ma do this, and I’ma do — it all seems like just a TikTok challenge or something. It’s very odd.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople have long labeled Black people with anti-Black coded terms like “street” or “ghetto” when the intention is to express something unpleasant — regardless of the target’s socioeconomic class. Those labels are also often used in a classist way to suggest that people living in poverty-stricken areas are inferior and violent, among other stereotypes.\n\nAs Jared Blake, senior producer at MSNBC, said in 2023, the term “ghetto” is often “used to describe something that is of lesser worth.”\n\nAnd the problem with coded terms — like the word “ghetto” — is that\n\n“it’s very difficult to disassociate it from its use to characterize low-income African Americans,” Mario Luis Small, professor of social science at Columbia University, told BBC News in 2016. “Thus, when ‘ghetto’ is used as an insult, it often sounds like a racial insult.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople on X, formerly Twitter, have slammed Ingraham and Arroyo’s remarks since the segment aired.\n\n“The moment they can’t find a good excuse, they start being racist,” one X user wrote.\n\n“This was filled with so much racial undertones. For a party that hates identity politics it’s always the first thing they go to,” wrote another.\n\nTabitha Bonilla, an associate professor of political science and human development and social policy at Northwestern University, told HuffPost that she thinks it’s disappointing that so much public dialogue — like Arroyo and Ingraham’s Fox News segment — has “decreased in substance,” but has increasingly invoked more “discriminatory and demeaning language.”\n\nShe said that she agrees with those online critiquing Ingraham and Arroyo, adding that their choice to label Crockett as “street” and to reference Perry’s Madea character “feels overtly racist.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Dog whistles tend to be subtle — you only understand them if you know what to listen for,” she said, pointing out that the comedic Madea character is meant to be laughed at and not taken seriously.\n\nThese are “not subtle references,” Bonilla said, adding that their conversation about Crockett’s remarks also felt dismissive.\n\n“There is no question in my mind that Ingraham and Arroyo are inciting racial stereotypes in their characterizations of Crockett,” said Deepak Sarma, Inaugural Distinguished Scholar in the Public Humanities at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In so doing they are, quite obviously, stoking the fears of their (already biased) viewers,” they continued. “I am not surprised and it is similar to the rhetoric put forth by [President Donald] Trump to dehumanize people who are not ‘white.’”\n\nSarma later added: “Using words like ‘street’ is akin to calling her a thug. Ironically, when GOP members such as Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene speak in derogatory ways they are always excused and often lauded.”\n\nMany of Crockett’s critics appear threatened by the way she speaks — and her presence overall, experts say.\n\nCrockett is often ridiculed for the way she speaks. Many of her most ardent critics online spew inflammatory remarks — usually rooted in anti-Black stereotypes — about her cadence or her use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) by calling her names like “ghetto queen” or “hood rat.”\n\nOthers have made attempts to argue that Crockett is disingenuous because the way she speaks doesn’t align with their views of how a member of Congress or someone who attended private school should speak.\n\nCrockett herself addressed some of these attacks in a TikTok video last month, saying it’s absurd that her critics have said her so-called “accent” is “fake” because she went to private school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I don’t have an ‘accent’ ... if anything it’s Texan, maybe mixed with a little bit of St. Louis,” she said. “And then determining that my ‘accent’ is fake because of the types of schools I went to ... seriously, y’all?”\n\nThe congresswoman said that the outrage over how she speaks proves that there are no real issues her critics could dig up about her.\n\n“By focusing on her expressions they are exemplifying just how deeply entrenched their historically dominant language game, which, is being threatened,” Sarma said about those criticizing the way Crockett speaks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Crockett’s critics are offended by her very existence, and her language is just one part of this,” they later continued. “The rise of MAGA and Trump have revealed that many Americans continue to see Black people as second-class citizens. Blacks in public and prominent positions threaten these derogatory stereotypes.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-snacks-for-aging-well_l_67eaa6a4e4b008c5a2ecc111",
    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nWe all want to stay healthy and active for as many years as we can, and one way to fight aging is to eat foods that support health at the cellular level.\n\nAging occurs in many ways, from our joints getting creaky to bigger problems, like dementia. Two processes are being studied for their role in aging: one is cell senescence and the other is damage to the telomeres on your DNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn cell senescence, a cell stops dividing normally and just hangs around, creating inflammatory chemicals that can harm surrounding cells. Telomeres, which are like little caps on the end of your DNA, fray and shorten as you age, which is associated with declining health. Both processes are affected by lifestyle, and can be decreased with good food choices.\n\nWe spoke with four nutrition experts to recommend the top snacks for slowing down the aging process. Here’s what they suggest snacking on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Veggies\n\nRaeanne Sarazen is a registered dietitian, chef, culinary nutrition consultant, and author of “The Complete Recipe Writing Guide.” She stressed “the importance of other lifestyle factors besides diet that contribute to healthy aging — that includes exercise, adequate sleep, minimizing alcohol consumption and stress management.” But in terms of foods to snack on, Sarazen recommends snacking on raw veggies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Keep in mind, there’s no magical anti-aging snack, but reaching for whole foods like colorful veggies, which are rich in fiber and antioxidants, can help,” she said. Studies show the nutrients in vegetables prevent cell senescence.\n\nBoiled Eggs\n\nSarazen is also a big fan of nutrient-packed eggs, which are full of protein, vitamins and eye-protecting compounds — all of which can make a difference to your health as you age. “[Boiled eggs] are simple, nourishing and delicious choices,” she said. Eggs are notable for their lutein, which protects eyesight, plus choline, omega-3 fats and protein.\n\nDark Chocolate\n\nAccording to registered dietitian Barbara Ruhs, “Dark chocolate is a delicious anti-aging food thanks to antioxidants, flavonoids and other bioactive components found naturally in plant foods.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to mention, cocoa flavanols have been shown to slow the progression of dementia and protect brain function.\n\n“To maximize its benefits, choose dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa and consider products that contain other plant ingredients,” Ruhs said.\n\nWhole Grains\n\nPicking whole-grain snacks, like low-sugar granola bars or popcorn, is a great way to protect yourself from aging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Whole-grain snacks are vital for a long and healthy life,” Ruhs said. “Whole grains are a source of dietary fiber, B vitamins and minerals — all of which add years to live and life to years. Look for the word ‘whole’ in the first three ingredients, if not as the first ingredient.”\n\nYogurt\n\nStudies show that consumption of live cultures is positively associated with cognitive ability. “Yogurt cups are a convenient and an economical way to maximize powerful anti-aging nutrients including calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, B vitamins and probiotics,” Ruhs said. “Consumed for thousands of years, yogurt is a staple in the Mediterranean diet.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFermented Foods\n\nRegistered dietitian Maya Feller, founder of Brooklyn-based Maya Feller Nutrition and author of “Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites From Cultures Around the World,” recommends eating live-cultured fermented foods, like fermented pickles, sauerkraut and kimchi.\n\n“Fermented food contains spermidine a natural polyamine that plays a roll in balancing the health of cells,” she said. “It’s also involved with improving mitochondrial function, and animal studies have found that spermidine may play a role in longevity.”\n\nDried And Smoked Fish\n\nIn Japanese, Korean and Southeast Asian cultures, snacking on dried anchovies is a popular and tasty way to add calcium and protein to a diet, and if you are unfamiliar with that, you can always try fish jerky or even open a can of sardines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This study looked at all small fish including dried fish and found that eating small fish was significant in terms of cancer risk reduction and all cause mortality in Japanese women,” Feller said.\n\nNori\n\nRegistered dietitian Jill Nussinow said, “Nori seaweed is one of my favorite easy-to-eat and lower-calorie snacks. Sea vegetables contain important minerals, especially iodine.” Studies show that seaweeds have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and can help to modulate aging-regulated pathways.\n\n“I recommend the little packages, called niru or seaweed snacks,” she added. “You can also use large nori sheets to make nori rolls, putting other high-nutrition items inside such as vegetable sprouts and avocado.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerries\n\n“Berries are on my list of foods that help with inflammation, as one of the highest sources of antioxidants,” Nussinow said.\n\nStudies show they have anti-inflammatory effects, which help protect your cells. “People usually think of blueberries but all berries such as strawberries, cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, huckleberries and more, are all important to include daily, if possible,” Nussinow said. “Dried berries are very easy to use and eat, but fresh or frozen work well, too, especially when it’s not truly berry season.”\n\nNuts And Seeds\n\nNuts and seeds have been found to have significant effects on cell health, preventing cell senescence and protecting your telomeres. They also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which slow cognitive decline."

    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/japanese-chefs-sushi-red-flags_l_67e6a8a5e4b086a4e8de5765",
    "text": "Whether it be fresh yellowtail sashimi or a piled-high rainbow roll, Americans love sushi. But when faced with an encyclopedia of fish options, it’s hard to know what to choose.\n\nThere’s long been a rumor that when you order tuna at some sushi restaurants, you’re actually just getting a worse-quality fish dyed red with food coloring. So it’s no wonder diners often feel wary when perusing a sushi menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe spoke to sushi chefs across the United States about what they look for when they order nigiri, sashimi and rolls, plus the biggest red flags to avoid before you pick up your chopsticks.\n\nColor Is Everything\n\nAll of our sushi experts agreed that the color of the fish is the No. 1 indicator that something’s not quite right. For chef Takeshi Ikeuchi, executive chef of Morimoto Asia in Disney Springs, Florida, it’s the first thing you should consider before taking a bite. “Diners should avoid anything that is dull or discolored,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChef Masatomo “Masa” Hamaya, culinary director of O-Ku and Junto in Bentonville, Arkansas, confirmed this is the biggest dealbreaker. He explained, “When it comes to any kind of fish, when you see the color changing or any discoloration, it’s a red flag because it’s oxidizing, which isn’t a good sign.” Once a fish oxidizes, it begins to break down fatty acids and turn rancid.\n\nIt Shouldn’t Look Dry\n\nFish should have a natural sheen and luster, like it’s straight from the dock to your dish. Mitsuhiro Eguchi, corporate sushi chef at Nobu Chicago, said, “Dry fish means there is a loss of freshness.” The same goes for the rice. Eguchi said, “If the rice is too hard or dry, that means the balance is off. That’s a sign of poor rice quality.”\n\nIt Should Smell Like The Ocean, Not Like Fish\n\nThere’s nothing worse than a fishy smell emanating from atop your rice. However, sushi chefs note there is a major difference between an “ocean” smell and a “fishy” smell.\n\nHamaya said, “Fish should exude the flavor of brine or the ocean. If you’re tasting the ocean, it’s full of umami because most fish have umami, and that’s normally a great sign. If it’s more fishy-fishy, then it’s about to be rotten.” And if the restaurant itself smells fishy, then it’s time to turn around and find a new sushi spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt Actually Shouldn’t Be Cold\n\nYou may think a cold piece of fish means it’s being properly refrigerated, but it’s a big sign the sushi chef isn’t a pro. Eguchi said, “Good sushi is served at a warm, human-touch temperature.” If there is a mismatch in temperature between the rice and the sushi, that’s how you know the chef’s sushi skills may not be up to par.\n\nAlways Judge The Display Case\n\nPerusing the clear display case stocked with fish is part of the fun of going out for sushi. But chefs urge you to take a good long look at the products inside to decide the freshness and quality of what’s being served. “A well-organized display case and fresh-looking fish with a natural sheen are good signs,” Eguchi said. If the display case is left open for long periods or looks messy, it’s a sign the chef may not be taking hygiene and organization seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck Out The Actual Restaurant\n\nThe cleanliness of the actual restaurant was another unanimous must from the sushi chefs we spoke to. “Restaurant cleanness is definitely among the most important aspects when ordering sushi. It shows the chef values the condition of his restaurant and the quality of the dining experience for guests,” said chef Masa Shimakawa at Soko in Santa Monica, California.\n\nEguchi added, “When I’m checking out a sushi place, I pay attention to a couple of things. First, how clean is the counter? And what about the chef’s hygiene? If the chef is constantly wiping their hands, I feel much better about the food.” No one wants food poisoning or, worse, a trip to the hospital.\n\nTop Ordering Tips\n\nWe’ve shared a lot of red flags and “don’ts,” but our experts have plenty of “do’s” for picking the best type of fish next time you’re out for sushi. Eguchi’s go-to is maguro (lean tuna) because it’s simple yet fundamental. He said, “Freshness and handling directly affect the taste.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuna is also a favorite of Shimakawa. “I love to order different cuts of tuna, as this is a great indicator of the quality of a restaurant. A good sushi restaurant always has high-quality tuna available,” he insisted.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

It has a lengthy preparation process, including a marinating period in vinegar, and can be difficult to execute well,” he said.\n\nWhen Hamaya orders sushi, he switches between a classic tuna nigiri and mackerel or sardines because “sushi chefs always cure them,” he said. “In order for them to cure it correctly, some sort of technique is required. The way chefs cure is different from chef to chef, and I can tell by eating their mackerel or sardines just how great their culinary technique is.”"

    "text": "This Handheld Tool Can Make Your Disgusting Mattress A Little Cleaner\n\nPart vacuum, part UV sanitizer, this cleaning device can help reduce allergies and kill germs in your mattress.\n\nIt’s accurate to assume that germs are lurking everywhere in your home, but your mattress is one particular place that harbors untold microorganisms that many of us prefer not to think about.\n\nIn fact, mattresses are more disgusting than you might ever have imagined, according to Manal Mohammed, a medical microbiologist and senior lecturer at London’s University of Westminster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“An average mattress can have thousands of dust mites that produce millions of droppings,” Mohammed said. She explained that these mites feed on particles like dead skin cells, saliva, sweat and even wayward food crumbs.\n\n“Many people can develop allergies to dust mite droppings,” Mohammed said. “And after prolonged exposure, some people, especially those with asthma, might develop severe symptoms and complications.”\n\nIt’s not just dust mites that you might be sharing a bed with. Due to how prone mattresses are to moisture and warmth, Mohammed warned against fungi, mold, viruses and bacteria such as E. Coli, MRSA and other serious contaminants that pose real risks to our health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you throw your mattress to the curb in advance of the recommended six-to-10-year time frame, Mohammed said there are some steps you can take to reduce the number of germs that you’re exposed to, including using a mattress-designated vacuum with a built-in UV sanitation light. Although she didn’t cite any model in particular, we found a highly reviewed mattress vacuum on Amazon that fits her guidance.\n\n“Vacuums with ultraviolet radiation will sanitize your mattress by killing germs [because] UV light will break apart their nucleic acid so they cannot reproduce and will subsequently die,” Mohammed said, adding that this step should be done at least once a month and can be especially important if you have allergies or pets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Housmile lightweight handheld mattress vacuum at Amazon claims to offer a powerful suction specifically designed to attract dust and mites, plus a drying function for eliminating bacteria-causing moisture. The device uses a twice-activated carbon filter and a HEPA filtration system, which Mohammed said is an important requirement when looking for mattress vacuums.\n\nThis vacuum cleaner has also been outfitted with a UV light, a method that, according to some studies, is proven effective in reducing pathogenic microorganisms in the way that Mohammed described.\n\nOf course, there are supplemental ways you can keep your mattress clean. Mohammed recommended things like bathing before going to bed, investing in a mattress cover that you can wash on a regular basis, avoiding eating in bed and changing your sheets and bedding once every two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA complete germ-free existence is not realistic (nor entirely necessary), but hopefully by following Mohammed’s advice you can rest easier knowing that your exposure is as reduced as possible, at least when it comes to your mattress. Keep reading to learn why some reviewers believe this mattress vacuum helped them do just that, or read even further to shop a list of some other great bed vacuums with similar germ-fighting features.\n\nPromising Amazon reviews:\n\n“I love this thing. I didn’t really know how to clean the couch other than a sticky roller and I am paranoid about sharing vacuums that are also used on the floor. I have had this for a few weeks and am really pleased. You can see particles collecting immediately. It passes smoothly over surfaces and isn’t very heavy. There is a button to be pushed for the roller to rotate so be sure you have that on. I was unsure if the UV light was functioning at first but it is a very dim light you can see through the collection chamber if you look closely. I believe it only comes on when flush to a surface. It takes a minute to heat up but I also like that feature for germ killing. The filter is easy to remove, rinse and replace into the collection bin. In addition to the couch I have also used this on pillows, mattress, chair and comforter. This product helps me feel more comfortable.” — Aubrey\n\n“I was skeptical, but desperate. I started to have really bad allergies which led to purchasing air purifiers, but I felt like there was more I could do. I saw a TikTok about this product and figured it wouldn’t be a bad thing to try. I have a cat and dog, so I was expecting to see a lot and I sure did! I’ve used this on pillows, mattresses, couches, rugs and have noticed a significant difference with my allergies! It picked up the small dust and allergens that I needed gone! I also have long hair, which is very easy to get off the rotating barrel inside - I’d recommend vacuuming first before using this product.” — Joelle V\n\n″This product has really made a difference in my battle with my allergies! I really thought that using a regular vacuum on my mattress and sheets was a good thing but this bed vacuum really made a difference and almost embarrassed me as I saw what it was picking up. Now I use it daily! In addition, I’m no longer waking up with itchy eyes and stuffy nose. I’m still taking meds and all other precautions and not claiming this to be a “miracle cure” but it’s really made a difference not only for me physically but mentally as well, as I’m now feeling that I’m taking the extra step and it’s making a difference. I’m so glad to have it!” — Ms. J\n\n1\n\nTisarja mattress and pillow cleaner\n\n2\n\nThe Dizikzo bed vacuum\n\n3\n\nThe Jimmy Bed vacuum cleaner\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"

    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hair-products-seal-split-ends_l_67e6a86de4b0ce900a291363",
    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nSplit ends are to hair what acne is to skin — a frustrating beauty dilemma that can be stubborn to fix.\n\nMany hair care formulas on the market claim to “zip up” or seal split ends, but is this actually possible, or is it marketing fluff? HuffPost spoke to hair experts, including trichologists and a hair stylist, to learn all about split ends, including what causes them, how to prevent them, and what to do if you have them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are split ends?\n\nTake a look at the ends of your hair. If you notice that they’ve frayed or split into two or more parts, you have split ends. The root cause? According to Kerry E. Yates, trichologist and founder of Colour Collective, split ends occur when the protective outer cuticle of the hair is compromised. “Without this protective layer, the inner cortex becomes exposed, causing the hair to weaken and separate at the ends,” she said.\n\nSara Hallajian, a Los Angeles-based trichologist, said there are four different types of split ends. A basic split is a “Y-shaped split where the cuticle has begun to separate,” she said. A feather split is when there are multiple splits along the same strand, indicating severe cuticle damage. A tree split refers to several small splits coming from one point, often due to extreme dryness. Finally, a knotted split is when a single strand forms a knot, which Hallajian said is common in curly or coily hair types.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes split ends?\n\nThere are several factors that can contribute to the damaging of the outer layer of hair. Unsurprisingly, heat styling is a culprit. As Yates explained, excessive heat from styling tools like flat irons, curling wands and blow dryers can weaken hair, leading to split ends. (Not to mention, the exposure to high temperatures strips hair of its natural moisture, making it dry.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When heat is too intense or used too often without protection, it can literally cook the hair from the inside out, causing the cuticle to crack and exposing the inner cortex — this breakdown makes hair more prone to fraying, breakage and split ends,” Yates said.\n\nWhile all hair lengths can get split ends, if you have a shorter style, you’re likely less prone to them due to the frequent trimming you get to keep up your style. This removes damaged ends before they have a chance to fray, Yates said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll hair types (straight, wavy, curly, coily) are prone to split ends, too. “The degree to which someone experiences split ends depends on their hair routine and exposure to damaging elements of heat styling and harsh chemicals,” said Paulina Raciborski, a hair stylist at NYC The Team hair salon.\n\nSplit ends can also be caused by mechanical or chemical damage. Mechanical damage refers to damage that occurs due to physical stresses put on the hair. This can be anything from rough brushing, wearing tight hairstyles often or using hair accessories that pull on the hair. “All of these factors weaken the hair over time, creating damage that leads to split ends,” Raciborski said.\n\nChemical damage, on the other hand, occurs when hair treatments like coloring, lightening and hair relaxing break down the hair’s natural structure, making the hair dryer and weaker. “Both types of damage — mechanical and chemical — wear down the protective cuticle and increase hair fragility,” Raciborski said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan split ends be “sealed”?\n\nThe short answer: No, split ends cannot be sealed. “Split ends are the splitting of one single hair shaft, and when there’s internal hair shaft damage, nothing can seal it,” Hallajian explained. The only real treatment for split ends is to get them cut. Raciborski recommended getting a trim every eight to 12 weeks to prevent split ends but noted that if you frequently heat style or get chemical treatments, getting a trim every six to eight weeks is ideal.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

Incorporate deep conditioning masks into your routine one to two times a week, limit heat styling and tight hairstyles, and brush the hair gently, especially when it’s wet (as this is the time when hair is the most fragile)."

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nIt was a typical weekday afternoon when Catherine S., a mother of four and part-time office clerk, decided to start taking her pleasure seriously. “I was stressed, tired … and didn’t feel like making dinner,” she recalled. Glancing over her calendar, she felt even worse.\n\n“It wasn’t that I didn’t love my life, because I did,” she added. “It was just becoming obvious that I needed to do something to feel a little better.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she started listening to spicy podcasts during her work commutes. Soon, she felt inspired to put her own erotic pleasure on her to-do list. “My goal wasn’t to have orgasms, exactly, but I gave myself 15 minutes with my vibrator once a week, which is how I [climax] easiest,” she said.\n\nCatherine nearly skipped her first session due to a headache. But when her phone alert sounded, she raced to her bedroom and went for it. “My headache was better after [my orgasm],” she said, “and so were my moods.”\n\nNow, several months of weekly sessions later, she often anticipates the practice as much as her morning coffee. The most dramatic benefit, she said, came as a surprise: “Orgasms have made me a more patient, less stressed out, and more loving mom.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResults like Catherine’s aren’t surprising to sexuality experts. While orgasms can’t alleviate all parenting-related challenges, they offer a range of advantages worth embracing.\n\nMore Pleasure, Less Stress\n\nOrgasms flood your system with feel-good chemicals like dopamine and oxytocin, explained board-certified sexologist and sex coach Lanae St. John. “Basically, they’re a shortcut from wired and overwhelmed to calm and content,” she said. “If stress has you clenched up like a fist, an orgasm is the unclench … the kind that makes you think, ′Why don’t I do that more often?’”\n\nIf you do up the frequency, even better. “When orgasms become a regular part of your routine, they’re not just reactive stress relief — they’re proactive emotional maintenance,” she said. “Think of it like watering your nervous system. Don’t wait until the plant’s wilted.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmotional Regulation And Patience\n\nIt makes sense that erotic releases help Catherine feel more patient with her kids. Beyond stress relief, orgasms can guard against a short emotional fuse.\n\n“Orgasms help regulate the central nervous system, calming you down,” said Nicolle Dirksen, a sex and couples therapist and clinic owner at Clover Counseling. “This can help you respond to parenting challenges with a calmer, cooler head.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImproved rest from orgasms may help your emotional health, too. A study using Fitbit technology showed that women who orgasmed before bed slept longer than women who didn’t. Given that sleep loss interferes with the parts of your brain that regulate your moods, more sleep can mean fewer angry, anxious and irritable moods.\n\nModeling Body Positivity And Self-Love\n\nWhile your little ones obviously won’t be around for your orgasms, they can benefit from any emotional strength they facilitate.\n\n“Kids are sponges, soaking up all of the vibes you give off — even, sometimes, those feelings you hold about yourself,” Dirksen explained. “Prioritizing your own pleasure can help reinforce positive feelings about your body, which means you can model for your children self-love and a positive relationship with your body.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine feels that her orgasmic play is bolstering her body confidence, and that her kids reap benefits. She especially appreciates that her nonbinary teen, who recently went through appearance-related bullying, will increasingly see “someone who’s unafraid to be in their body … without looking like a model.”\n\nImproved Partner Connection\n\nIf you’re coparenting with a sexual partner, shared orgasmic forays may deepen your bond, according to Dirksen.\n\n“Regularly orgasming with a partner increases and improves intimacy and connection, two things that [tend] to decline once you become parents,” she said. “This increased connection can help remind you that you’re teammates, something that can be super important during those tougher days of parenthood.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine and her husband often feel like “sliding doors,” she said, given their contrasting schedules. When she told him about her orgasm sessions, they decided to plan occasional pleasure dates. “We may or may not have sex,” she said, “but we make time, even 20 minutes, to connect … where we both get to have pleasure.”\n\nWhen Pleasure Feels Out Of Reach\n\nPrioritizing your pleasure can be challenging while child-rearing. And your mindset can play a big role.\n\n“Parenting often comes with a lot of guilt … especially about anything we think might be self-serving,” Dirksen explained. “Self-pleasure feels like a luxury, saved only for the perfect circumstances: enough time, privacy, energy … things parents have very little of.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo turn that around, she suggests a reframe: “Focusing on and prioritizing your kids’ needs makes you a great parent. But making time for your own needs and pleasure is also a sign of a great parent.”\n\nAnd when time runs scarce, incorporate delight into the mundane. “Wear something that makes you feel sexy or listen to music that moves you while you wash the dishes or do the laundry,” she said. “Savor your morning coffee, distraction-free.”\n\nGiving Yourself Grace (And Pleasure)\n\nLastly, don’t stress if sex doesn’t appeal to you like it used to, which is common during baby years and for moms (and any parents) who bear the brunt of caregiving. That may change as your kids gain independence or you gain support. Regardless, there’s no sexual epitome to strive for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many parents, it’s challenging to “switch seamlessly between the roles of caregiver and sexual being,” according to Jillian Amodio, a licensed therapist and author. “It’s OK to be exactly where you are, to explore the ‘why’ behind these changes, and, if desired, to take steps toward reconnecting with your sensual self in a way that feels authentic to you.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nIn the self-checkout, my 3-year-old son Joey insists on helping me scan our groceries. He moves in slow motion, his tiny hands fumbling with the bag of clementines, the fruit snacks, the milk. The line behind us is growing. I can feel the weight of impatient eyes, hear the exaggerated sighs.\n\n“We have to hurry up, Joey. People are waiting,” I say, reaching for the next box he’s trying to grab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can do it by myself,” he screams.\n\nI check my frustration, taking deep breaths with a clenched jaw as we make our way through the last few items. When we finish, an older man walking past smiles at us and says, “I miss that age. All mine are grown. Enjoy every minute — goes by too fast.”\n\nI smile, but in that moment, the last thing I feel is enjoyment. Instead, I feel like I’m failing. Like I’m missing something that other parents seem to have — some endless supply of patience, some innate sense of ease, some certainty that they were born for this role. And that I wasn’t. At least, that’s how it feels.\n\nBut not every moment is like this. There are plenty that fill me with joy, moments that remind me why this love is so deep, so all-consuming. Like when Joey grabs my face with both hands, presses his nose to mine, and whispers, “I love you, Mommy.” Or when he climbs on top of our dog, Sundae, giggling as he asks me to take a photo. When he belts out “I’m Still Standing” from “Sing,” his tiny pointer fingers stabbing the air to the beat, completely lost in the music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my favorite — when he asks me to rock him to sleep. We listen to the playlist I started when I was pregnant, and he fades away to the same sounds he’s heard since before he was born. These are the moments I wish I could freeze. These are the moments I feel I’m right where I belong.\n\nOne night, after a particularly rough bedtime battle, I found myself at my desk, my face buried in my hands as I choked back tears. My fingers traveled under my hair and I yanked hard, as if trying to scalp myself — peeling away a version I’m ashamed of, a version I can’t stand. I was reliving 10 minutes ago — me snapping at my restless little boy, raising my voice, frustrated he wasn’t lying down as I asked. I saw his face change, his lip moving into a pout. I heard his fragile voice tell me, “You’re making me sad.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis words echoed in my mind, and the feeling I got inside my body was how I imagine it must feel to wake up during surgery because your anesthesia ran out. I could feel them slicing through me — going deeper and deeper and deeper.\n\nI was destroyed. Crippled with shame of my actions, hating myself for the hurt I caused him. And I thought: Maybe I wasn’t meant to be a mother. What kind of mother yells at her kid for not wanting to sleep? He deserves so much better than me.\n\nThe guilt was suffocating. I should go back in, I told myself. I should apologize, kiss his forehead, whisper in his ear that I love him so much. But I didn’t move. Because I didn’t feel like I deserved to. Like I didn’t deserve his forgiveness. Like I didn’t deserve him. Because in that moment, I felt like the worst mother in the world. So I sat there, stuck in my own self-hatred, convinced that I was failing at the most important thing I will ever do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn therapy, I confessed this to my counselor, Meaghan Grabowski, who at this point feels like the only person I can be brutally honest with about these types of feelings. When I interviewed her for this story, she shared some advice.\n\n“How is it possible to enjoy every moment of anything, let alone something so challenging and complex as parenting?” she asked. “That being said, the fact that you feel guilt about it is extremely normal.”\n\nGrabowski says difficult emotions do not equal bad emotions. “Do we say the same thing about our careers? About school? About marriage? Every experience comes with challenges, and it doesn’t do anyone any good to deny the reality of those challenges.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, mothers are held to a different standard. “It’s supposed to be the most important, most amazing, most fulfilling thing that you do,” Grabowski said. “We don’t give that same messaging to fathers. Mothers are somehow supposed to make everything about their children and also not make everything about their children, which is an impossible contradiction.”\n\nThat contradiction breeds shame. When someone tells me to “enjoy every moment,” what I hear is: If you don’t, you’re ungrateful. If you’re frustrated, if you’re struggling, if you’re counting the minutes until bedtime, you’re a horrible human being.\n\nGrabowski says self-esteem issues and perfectionism play into this, too. “If you are a perfectionist, you’re going to struggle with anything that feels like criticism. Whether it’s meant to be a criticism or not, an unprompted piece of advice telling you how you should feel about a moment with your child — or even just about being a mother in general — is going to feel like a criticism and a comparison that you’re not measuring up.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that’s exactly how I feel — like I’m never measuring up. Like no matter how much I love my son, I will never be a “good mother.”\n\nThe pressure to feel a certain way about motherhood isn’t unique to me, of course. Amy Klein, author of ”The Trying Game,” has been there, too. After enduring four miscarriages and years of infertility treatments, she felt added pressure to be thankful for every second of motherhood. “For the first six months to a year, I felt like I couldn’t complain,” she told me. “I felt like I had to be grateful all the time.”\n\nAs mothers, we often say, I should feel this or I shouldn’t feel that. “I try to tell people, you should just feel what you feel,” Klein said. Her wish is that every mom and mom-to-be will allow themselves the full range of feelings — even the difficult ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelissa Petro, author of ”Shame on You: How to Be a Woman in the Age of Mortification” has written extensively about how shame is weaponized against mothers. “Our whole economy really relies on mothers doing all of this work without complaint,” Petro said. “If we internalize our struggle rather than externalizing it, then we’re more likely to just try harder than to fight back against the forces that are just so utterly out of our control.”\n\nFor parents drowning in guilt, Petro recommends finding someone you can be totally honest with. “Finding that just-right friend — that person who can listen and reflect back the truth of your experience — is just so powerful and important, especially when we’re struggling. And especially when we’re struggling through something that’s so mystified and misunderstood as mothering,” she said. “Finding people who really reflect the truth of your experience — those are the people that are going to embolden you and empower you.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

She dealt with postpartum anxiety, and when people told her to “enjoy every moment,” it only made her feel worse. She told me, “I was trying to apply all these efficiency things — all the things that had made me so successful at work — trying to apply it to this baby, which obviously doesn’t work. And it would just send me into a tailspin.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow a mother of two, Finney Harden has made it her mission to provide a more realistic voice in motherhood, using her social media to tell struggling parents, “If you actually think this is terrible and you can’t stand when people say ‘enjoy every moment,’ come talk to me.

    "text": "The last few years have served as a reminder of the importance of good travel health practices. From frequent hand-washing and sanitizing to face masks, there are many ways people can practice strong hygiene and ward off disease when they’re on the road.\n\nBut after returning home from vacation, there’s another step many still overlook: cleaning their suitcases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There are two types of people in this world — one who unpacks as soon as they get back from a trip and one who leaves it sitting there for a few days,” Jamie Adams, the “cleanfluencer” behind Jamie’s Journey, told HuffPost. “But how many people take the time to clean their luggage when they get back?”\n\nExperts recommend giving your suitcase a good cleaning between every trip you take.\n\n“Your luggage picks up more dirt and germs than you might realize, from conveyor belts to hotel rooms,” said Courtney Landry, a product development manager with Norwex. “The exterior of your suitcase becomes a host to millions of bacteria as it travels, collecting dust, dirt and debris.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleaning your luggage when you return home is not just about keeping dirt away but about protecting your health by warding off bacteria and other harmful pathogens. Microbiologist Jason Tetro, aka “The Germ Guy,” emphasized that a piece of luggage can be a vehicle for the spread of infection.\n\n“Put it this way ― ask yourself if you have cleaned your hands before you touched your face,” he said. “Most likely the answer is no. What was on that handle that could potentially make you sick? You won’t know. No one can, really. So, it’s best to take the precaution and ensure that you are not putting yourself at risk. Luggage touches everything on the journey, so the best thing to do is keep the surface clean and safe.”\n\nDon’t forget that suitcase interiors can also get dirty.\n\n“The shoes and clothes we wear can bring in dirt and bacteria ― and in some climates, bugs ― inside the suitcase,” Adams said. “So make sure to add cleaning the inside of your luggage to your post-trip un-packing routine!”\n\nIn addition to protecting your health, cleaning the inside and outside of your luggage will also keep it fresh and help extend the lifespan of your suitcases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Luggage is quite an investment, so I want to take care of it,” said Patric Richardson, author of “House Love: A Joyful Guide to Cleaning, Organizing, and Loving the Home You’re In.”\n\n“I want the suitcase to last, and it’s just nice to have a clean suitcase,” he added. “It makes going on vacation and getting home more pleasant.”\n\nHow To Clean The Outside\n\nLuggage manufacturers typically offer cleaning guidance for their products, which customers should consult, but if you can’t find specific instructions, the experts who spoke to HuffPost also offered their best practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The best way to clean the outside parts of luggage would be to get some soapy water or a multi-purpose cleaner and a scrub brush,” Adams said.\n\nShe recommended getting a bowl or bucket of water and mixing dish soap like Dawn or any multi-purpose cleaner like Mr. Clean with water.\n\n“Then, gently scrub the entire exterior with the soapy water,” Adams advised. “Pay special attention to the handle and wheels! The handle is a main touch point that can harbor a lot of bacteria.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to scrubbing the handle and wheels with soapy water, she also recommended running a disinfecting wipe over those areas, as well as the zipper and any other spots you want to treat.\n\n“For the most part, the outside parts are like your hands, except that instead of a sink, you can use the tub,” Tetro said. “Soap and water is really all you need to keep them clean and safe. If you would rather not use the tub, then you can always use a disinfectant. Make sure you leave the product on the surface for a minimum of three minutes.”\n\nThe soap and water approach works for both hard- and soft-shell luggage, though you might want to use a little less water if your suitcase exterior is made of fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The great thing about suitcase fabrics is they’re really durable,” Richardson said. “I dip a towel into a mixture of dish soap and water, and I just kind of wipe it all down. Then I take another towel with clear water and wipe it down again to rinse it.”\n\nBe prepared to use some elbow grease on visible spots that require extra care.\n\n“There’s no worse feeling than picking up your suitcase from baggage claim and spotting a big scuff or dark stain,” Landry said.\n\nShe suggested using multipurpose cleaning solution on a damp microfiber cloth. Cleanfluencer Sharon Garcia is a fan of Fabuloso for tougher stains or dirt buildup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the process, consider putting your suitcase outside for quick drying if it’s warm out, or just let it air out in your house for a bit before putting it away. Do what you can to keep your luggage clean and fresh until you need it again.\n\n“I always store my clean luggage in giant trash bags in the garage to protect it from dust and pests,” Garcia said. “This ensures my luggage remains clean and ready for the next adventure!”\n\nHow To Clean The Inside\n\n“The best way to clean the interior of a suitcase is to first use a blow dryer or a handheld vacuum to get rid of dirt or sand that may be sitting in the bottom of the suitcase,” Adams said. “Then scrub the inside with a damp, soapy microfiber cloth.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with the exterior, use disinfecting spray or wipe the interior down with a disinfecting cloth.\n\n“Nothing beats a disinfectant wipe for this purpose,” Tetro said. “It’s quick, reliable and fast. Just make sure that it is compatible with the fabric. You can also spray rubbing alcohol onto the surfaces and let it dry. Alcohol is a great sanitizer for both hands and fabrics.”\n\nIf you’ve spilled your travel shampoo or soap, try to attack those spots as well.\n\n“I use vinegar and water and spray it thoroughly until it’s very damp,” Richardson said. “Then I wipe it clean with a dry towel. Vinegar can cut through soap. And if there’s a moldy smell or anything from packing your suitcase with damp items, that will help as well.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "When I was four years old, my dad’s job transferred him north, so he and my mom moved our family to Canada for six years. While living there, they decided that we should all become Canadian citizens. I don’t know what compelled my parents to go through the process of gaining citizenship for all of us in a country we didn’t plan to live in very long, but I’m glad they did. Through the years, it’s always felt like a safety net for me, especially as anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment here in the United States has increased.\n\nLast summer, as the presidential election loomed, my wife and I talked frequently about what it would look like if we decided to take our two kids and leave the country. We understood, and still do, that we’re “protected” here in New York, but when you’re an LGBTQ+ family, it doesn’t matter where you live, or how safe you feel: You must always have a plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Nov. 5, my plan was to cry. All the time. But I had to make dinner for my kids and do the laundry. I also had a deadline for an article I was writing, and I needed to get in touch with my sources.\n\nI have a professional acquaintance in the Midwest who, like me, is queer, married, and raising two kids. I had an unusually difficult time getting her on the phone for our early November interview. “I know this is a challenging time,” I texted, “just let me know when you’re free.” When I finally did get to speak with her, she confessed why she’d been so busy. It wasn’t simply the exhausting aftermath of an election that devastated much of the queer community; she and her trans husband were moving their family abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was impressed. I don’t know a single person in my queer community who hadn’t considered their own exit strategy in the wake of a Trump administration. I also didn’t know anyone who was actually going through with it. Gina, who requested to withhold her last name for her family’s safety, told me, “I don’t want to live here feeling angry and hurt. It’s not good for my mental well-being, feeling betrayed by people everywhere I go.”\n\nGina and her husband put their house on the market immediately following the election, and it sold right away. Then, they had to face the harsh logistics of moving their family abroad. She told me that the planning was difficult, but that staying would be worse.\n\n“It’s hard just to be in public. I look around and I think, half of the people in this room voted to hurt us, and did that because they are either ignorant, or they hate us,” she said.\n\nLeaving the place they call home is emotional for Gina and her family, but she wants to keep them safe. “If we live somewhere where our rights are protected at a federal level, that might feel like a relief,” she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe logistics of moving abroad\n\nGina introduced me to Jess Drucker, founder of Rainbow Relocation, a nationwide organization founded to “empower queer folks and their families to move, live, and thrive aboard.” Drucker told me that previously, she worked with individuals and families who were looking for an adventure abroad. In November, she was inundated with requests for help.\n\n“The increase is definitely threat-based and fear-based,” she said.\n\nDrucker is also working more than ever with trans people, she told me. “That’s the group that feels the most under threat and has the most rush on their paperwork for gender markers, gender identity and passports. That’s much more complex,” she said.\n\nI inquired about which countries people were looking into, and Drucker confessed, “I’m a bit of a dream-killer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People are looking at the world as a buffet of country options,” she told me, but what they actually need to consider is their own value. If you’re wealthy, you might consider a European Golden Visa, which offers foreign investors a temporary residence permit if they maintain an investment – usually real estate – within the country. Some nations offer temporary residence to highly skilled migrants, which are foreigners with advanced degrees or specialized professions who will bring their skills to the nation’s workforce.\n\n“If you don’t offer professional value, you can still offer something to economically insecure countries,” Drucker explained. There are volunteer opportunities in countries that are queer and trans friendly, like Nicaragua or Bolivia.\n\nShe was also clear that it is extremely difficult for LGBTQ+ Americans to seek asylum.\n\n“Going [abroad] and hoping to get asylum status comes at great financial peril should that claim get rejected and you have to move back to the US,” she said. “If you are going to move your life — a costly endeavor, of course — you might as well become as informed as possible how to do that with intention, on visas that you can qualify for, in countries that are safe.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach\n\nMike Garda, a New York-based therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, told me that initially, he had many conversations with his patients about moving. “I’ve observed a pretty steep decline in discussions about leaving the country, as folks have had more time to process, receive community care, and at times confront the reality of how difficult it would be to move abroad,” he said.\n\nOnce the initial shock had worn off, Garda was able to shift conversations to what was within his clients’ control. “I helped many of my clients identify things they felt were possible to complete promptly and preemptively, such as name changes, gender marker designations and renewing passports,” he said. “I don’t think these conversations are over, and I expect that as we see new legislation roll out, folks will continue to mourn and look for a way to escape the pain of being marginalized and systematically oppressed.”\n\nEven Garda admitted that he had considered leaving, but ultimately he didn’t feel it would be right. “I think it would be incredibly privileged to move to Europe and continue to work virtually with clients who are unable to exert the same mobility. I think this is a time for queer resistance whether that is through activism, coalition-building [or] simply existing as we are,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many in the queer community, we will simply have to wait and see what happens. “I would love to be wrong,” Gina told me. “I would love to end up looking foolish for going abroad with our children for a couple of months or years. Wouldn’t that be the best-case scenario?”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires. We Work For You.\n\nBig money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

For people who can’t afford her fees, her Facebook group Queer Expats is a great place to connect and find helpful resources. The group’s membership grew by the thousands in the days following the election. “If a whole community is feeling scared, then we need to take it pretty seriously,” she said.\n\nFor now, my family is staying put and turning to our community for strength. I can’t imagine leaving my loved ones, even as I mourn the future that I wanted for my children and the rights we stand to lose. Every LGBTQ+ American is faced with a choice right now about how to stay safe, how to move forward and how best to embody our own queer resistance. It’s okay if that resistance looks like a relocation abroad, engaging in activism or just simply existing as usual and living our everyday lives. My dual citizenship is a safety net I feel lucky to have, but my hope is that — for now — I won’t have to use it."

    "text": "When I was offered an exciting “dream” job working in the dean’s office of a medical school in New York City a few years ago, it posed a challenge. This would be an opportunity for me to live my values, really make a difference and also meet a long-held dream of living in New York. I wanted to say “yes.” But my wife, Pat, and I lived in New Hampshire, and I needed to have some long talks with her before I made a move.\n\nWe’d been practicing “intentional” decision-making for 30 years, and this decision was going to be a tough one. On one hand, our kids were grown and out of the house, the med school I had been working for was in a bit of turmoil, and I was ready for a change. On the other hand, Pat loved her job and her garden and had no desire to move. I proposed a plan that I buy a hybrid car, return home every weekend to help with house and dog chores, and call every day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Darling, I’d really like to try this, 80-20,” I told Pat. “I’m excited but frightened. 80-20.”\n\nWe talked it over for days.\n\n“I’m in favor, too,” Pat eventually told me, “55-45. I’m nervous, too, but you should go for it. 55-45.”\n\nDone. The decision was made. But what just happened?\n\nOur numerical negotiation routine started when we first began dating. We were both interns in a family medicine residency in upstate New York, working about 80 hours a week, and on call every third night. Two weeks after Pat and I began to go out, we had a rare free evening and had to decide between eating Mexican or Chinese food. We had heard good things about the Mexican restaurant, but we also enjoyed the Chinese joint where we had our first date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis question — where to eat? — quickly turned into a meta-question: How do the two of us decide where to eat? If we chose to deliberate, we knew that each would try to please the other, to figure out which restaurant the other person favored. We were aware that the initial steps in a relationship are important, and we were both committed to equity and equality. This decision, then — Mexican or Chinese — became a touchstone and metaphor for us. How could each of us express what our preference was without stepping on — or simply influencing — the other?\n\nPat suggested that we each independently decide which restaurant we preferred, and then compare our choices. We had to agree to be honest and stick to our choice. “But wait,” she reflected, “that won’t work. What if I say Chinese and you say Mexican? Then all we have is conflict, not a decision.”\n\nWe pondered this for a few seconds, and then — since we were both comfortable with numbers and quantitative thinking — I proposed that we add a weighting to our preference. If Pat preferred Chinese because she really wanted to reinforce those “first date” pheromones, it would be a lot stronger than if she just wanted to check out their moo shu chicken. Similarly, she couldn’t know if I wanted to go to Mexican just for a change of pace, or if I had secretly arranged for a special mole sauce for the enchiladas.\n\n“Let’s do it this way,” I proposed. “Not only do we each have to quietly commit to our preference, but we have to say how strongly we feel about that choice.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe agreed to use a scale of 0 to 100. Preferring a choice 60-40 would be a modest preference for the former choice over the latter, 90-10 would be a very strong preference, and 50-50 would mean an honest “I truly don’t have preference” between the two options.\n\nThen — as if playing rock-paper-scissors — we each would state our preference and weighting. The restaurant that had the higher combined weighting would win our business. It was simple!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, just as our relationship was beginning, we decided we would each have to be honest about our own preferences and needs. In this case, Chinese won. I like noodles and she likes eggplant!\n\nClearly stating our preferences — and especially the meaning of a 50-50 — had another important resonance beyond suggesting that either choice would be OK: 50-50 indicated the equality we sought. Both of us identify as feminists and came up strong in anti-war and civil rights movements, and we felt moral injury if the wishes of one of us would systematically hold sway over the other. So, with a smile, we’d say “five-oh-five-oh” as a mantra to renew the commitment to our ideals.\n\nA problem that soon arose was that we could each feel more strongly than the other about different small things. I prefer to wash dishes. Pat prefers to brush the dogs. I prefer to do mechanical repairs, and she prefers to iron and sew. The fact that some of these preferences fell along traditional gender expectations was an irony that we appreciated. But the thoughtful and explicit balance of those household chores was a potential fork in the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe saw other couples implicitly divide up the responsibilities, just as they implicitly made the decisions about what to have for dinner. We also saw other couples begin to drift apart, and we figured out that under that drift was, actually, resentment.\n\nResentment can build from one person seeming to get their way more than the other. It can lead to feeling that you are owed something in the relationship. If a partner doesn’t get what is owed, that may be what triggers the drift. Since we were both in favor of clear communication — as family doctors, we specialized in listening — we decided that resentment about what was unfair or unsaid could be averted by being up front and explicit all of the time.\n\nWell, OK, most of the time.\n\nWhen Pat came home from her 36-hour shift completely exhausted — both physically and emotionally — I knew to greet her with a hug and a cup of tea, and not remind her that she had agreed to not leave her knitting projects on the dining room table and the hall table. I’d raise that later. But it would be important to let her know at some point soon. Otherwise, my tendency to obsessively tidy our surfaces would bother both of us and lead her to resent my putting her piles away as much as I resented her making those piles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo we began to use the 0-to-100 scale to describe how much we liked or disliked various behaviors as well as choices. If her piles were only upsetting me 55-45, I could live with them. If they were really bothering me, it’d be 80-20, and I’d have to find a way to say something. It was my job, not hers, to know how I felt and to express it clearly. And if I procrastinated in fulfilling my promise to fix the tangle of computer and television cords in the living room — and this made her gnash her teeth every time she passed through — she’d point at it and quietly say “70-30.” Then I would bump that chore up to the top of my to-do list.\n\nAlthough household duties and dinner preferences were just the small things, we — then and now — try to end each week with a pretty reasonable balance. We each get what we want about 50% of the time. And if things begin to feel out of balance — if I begin to feel that Pat is “winning” more than I am — well, whose fault is that? If she is 70-30 a lot and gets her preference, maybe it means that I need to be clearer and more certain. Maybe I need to be 75-25 rather than 60-40. If I do not get what I want, it is my fault, not hers. And if we are both escalating our preferences to 80-20 and 90-10, maybe there are some real problems. To cover that eventuality, we agreed to go see a therapist if necessary, and we did have to do that once.\n\nThe system works most handily with quick decisions — which couch to buy, which charity to support, when to give up on a long line at the coffee shop. The test of the technique came with the big decisions. With the passing years we had to decide when and where to vacation, buy a larger home, get married, move, have children, move again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the stakes became higher, the need for clarity and honesty also grew, and it was useful to have our numerical system to help us. Pat felt very strongly that our “forever” home should have places for her to garden (“80-20”), and this desire readily outweighed my desire to not have a lot of lawn to mow (“60-40”).\n\nHow would we know without a language? We love each other, but neither of us is a mind reader. Love does not mean precisely knowing what the other person wants or needs at all times. It means respecting the other person to fully honor their wants and needs without sacrificing our own. And it sometimes means asking.\n\nSome of the big things were tougher to rectify, and the numerical system did not always magically work or feel appropriate. If one of us enjoyed sex more than the other — and, yes, that happened — the decision about when, where and how became a bit tougher. If she comes into the bedroom with a spring in her step and a little grin on her face, I might think that the odds of a good night were pretty high. At that moment I am not going to whisper steamily into her ear, “Yeah, honey, 90-10 to go ahead, how about you?” And making decisions about raising our children required consensus more than instant resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as we age, as our bodies grow slacker and slower, and our minds are not as sharp, we have to be even kinder with each other, so there are fewer instances of 90-10. And even though “five-oh-five-oh” remains a central theme of our marriage, we still are careful to be honest when we truly have a preference.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

We would have had a full semester on the right way to do laundry, run the vacuum and set out the recycling. Or we’d have had to take an Advanced Placement test on how to load the dishwasher, which for most of us would have helped our daily life more than knowing how to find the length of the missing side of a triangle.\n\nBut we live in a world where trigonometry gained dominance over home economics. No wonder we can’t all get along, with everyone quarreling about which direction silverware should face in the little flatware basket. With the goal of restoring a modicum of domestic harmony, we talked to home and cleaning experts about all things dishwasher related.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe experts offered reassurance that the struggle is real.\n\nMorgan Eberhard, a leading principal scientist for Procter & Gamble’s North America Home Care business, hears the bickering all the time. “It’s one of the most argued-about chores between partners and roommates,” she said. “Everyone feels like their way of doing it is the right way.”\n\nHome and lifestyle expert Jill Bauer, who is a frequent contributor on the “Today” show, said questions on dishwasher loading “are usually at the top of the list” from her fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust in time for tonight’s after-dinner cleanup, here’s the latest on crusty pots, smeared glassware and even which way the flatware should face. No AP test required.\n\nLoad With ‘Water Reach’ In Mind\n\nAre you always the first one to bend way over and stick that dirty cereal bowl into the far reaches of the newly empty dishwasher, thus clearing the way to more easily load the next bit of crockery? And are you expecting a medal for this?\n\nAs important as your contributions are, Eberhard said the focus on front or back pales in significance to the “water reach” issue. Considering where the water comes from is the key to proper loading, she said. “The water source rotates outward from the center of the machine through the spray arms, and you want as clear a path as possible between water spray and dirty dishes.”\n\nInstead of worrying about front or back, she said, “You need to prioritize proper placement to ensure water reach. Larger items are often best placed toward the back or sides of the lower rack, as this is less likely to block the detergent dispenser or spray arm.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat’s On Top: Cups, Mugs, Bowls And Glassware\n\nThe top rack is the place for cups, mugs and bowls. “Put them face down, between the prongs, to prevent rattling. This way they’ll also get cleaned better and won’t collect water,” Eberhard said.\n\nWhen it comes to items like wine glasses and other delicate glassware, she suggested leaving them a finger-width apart on the top rack or using the stemware holder if your dishwasher has one. Anything that’s made of plastic belongs on the top rack, she said. “Temperatures typically remain cooler on the top rack, which will prevent melting,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we’re talking about placement, you might want to take a look at the cabinets above your dishwasher and load with an eye to where the clean items will eventually go, said Becky Rapinchuk, cleaning expert and founder of Clean Mama: “Group items like glasses, cups, bowls and plates together, so it’s easy to grab a stack and put them all away at once.”\n\nFlatware And Pots: Don’t Spoon Your Spoons\n\nWhile Eberhard suggested always putting the dirtiest part of a utensil facing up in the flatware basket, there are different viewpoints. Rapinchuk does it this way: “I prefer to load dirty forks tines-down and dirty spoons bowl-down, so when you’re unloading, you’re not touching what’s going to be put into someone’s mouth.”\n\nFor Bauer, it’s important to mix things up in the flatware basket. “You want to spread out how many are facing up and down,” she said. “Don’t load all of your spoons together, because you don’t want your spoons to ‘spoon’ each other and hide the dirt.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPots are bottom-rack placement only, Bauer said, citing the “water reach” issue that Eberhard mentioned earlier. “The key is making sure that on the bottom rack, your dishes are facing the water source, which is in the middle. She said to avoid putting them face down, and to place them on their sides instead.\n\n“Otherwise, they’ll hog all the water, which will spray just up into that pot and not be able to disperse and spray other dishes,” she said.\n\nWhat Can’t Go In There\n\nWhile most things do fine in the dishwasher, there are a few no-go items. Rapinchuk cautioned against putting nonstick pans in the dishwasher. “The high heat can disintegrate nonstick surfaces,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m wary of putting fine china into the dishwasher,” Bauer said. “The force of the water could cause damage, and the detergents could dull the finish on some of the metallic accents of a pattern.” She did point out that some dishwashers have a gentle/china setting. “If you feel comfortable using that cycle, just don’t overload the dishwasher, as you don’t want the dishes to rattle against each other and potentially chip,” she added.\n\nAnother no-no is anything sharp, she said. “I always think it’s best to wash knives by hand. The heat can do damage to the handles, and the way the knives jiggle around in the utensil basket can eventually cut through the basket’s bottom.”\n\nEberhard mentioned a few more items that should never see the inside of a dishwasher: anything made from aluminum, cast iron or wood, plus any insulated travel mugs or homemade ceramics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScrape And Rinse? Or Fuhgeddaboudit?\n\nWars have been fought over less, but Rapinchuk diplomatically agreed that, when it comes to scraping and rinsing (or not), “the topic is controversial.” She herself scrapes off excess food, does a quick rinse and then loads items into the dishwasher. “I prefer to do this because I feel like everything gets cleaner, and it’s less work for the dishwasher and filter,” she said.\n\nBauer agreed, with a clear definition. “Scraping and rinsing doesn’t mean washing the dishes by hand before loading,” she clarified. “But you definitely want to get all of the loose food scraps off so they don’t clog your dishwasher filter and cause problems with the way your machine functions. If you’ve left something in your sink that is really caked on, let it sit with some hot water on it for a few minutes before loading, to soften the residue a bit.”\n\nAs you’re getting ready to hit the “on” button, consider this pro tip: “Before you run the dishwasher, start your kitchen faucet running on hot water, and then press ‘start,’” Rapinchuk said. “It’ll heat up the dishwasher more quickly.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Full Should The Dishwasher Be?\n\nYou don’t want to overload, Eberhard said: “Because you want the water to reach every dish, it’s important not to overpack the dishwasher or stack dishes on top of one another. If it’s too full, you might be preventing the water and detergent from being able to reach all of the dirty parts of the dishes.”\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "Whether you’re moving into a new home or upgrading your current space, it can be overwhelming to decide how exactly you want to decorate it and make it your own. Does the paint color look too dark? Is the living room too crowded? Does the ambience feel positive and welcoming?\n\n“Having a well-balanced space not only enhances the look and feel … but it also creates a psychological impact,” said Scheherazade Lunn, a certified interior decorator and founder of Lunn Interiors. “Just like [how] a clean home creates a sense of calm … the same can be said about a well-designed space.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked to interior decorators and designers about the one thing they avoid doing when decorating their own homes — and why that makes a difference in creating a space that makes them feel comfortable and happy.\n\nMistake #1: Selecting The Paint Color Of A Room First\n\n“One [mistake] I always see people [make] … is they [choose their paint color] right away,” said Natasha Habermann, interior designer, decorator and owner of Natasha Habermann Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe suggests this should actually be the last step when decorating your home. Because there are thousands of paint color options, she advises first picking out the decor and accessories you really love and then choosing the paint based on that. For example, even if you know you want a light blue room, it’s easier to match the exact shade once you already have the bedding, rugs and other decorative items you want for the space.\n\n“[Otherwise] you’ll just always be fighting the paint rather than getting the paint to work with everything else that you’ve already selected,” she said.\n\nBeyond looking at the decor and accessories, she also recommends thinking about how you plan to use the room you’ll be painting.\n\n“It’s really about what sort of ambience you’re trying to create in the room,” she added. “Think about the time of day that you’re living in the space.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may want a more “bright and upbeat” color for a room where you spend daytime hours, like a kitchen, and a more “cozy” color for where you spend time in the evening, like a bedroom, she said.\n\nMistake #2: Incorporating Too Many Trends\n\n“I firmly believe in prioritizing timeless pieces over fleeting trends when decorating my home,” Lunn shared. “Trends can be fun, but they shouldn’t be the focal point of your space.”\n\nShe recommends adding trends through smaller items that you can refresh later on if you decide, such as decorative throw pillows, lamps and coffee table accessories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Larger investment pieces like sofas tend to draw a significant amount of attention in a room, so it’s essential to choose furnishings that will withstand the test of time,” she explained.\n\nTimeless pieces are usually “classic styles with historical significance,” whereas trendy items may have a unique, modern take.\n\n“By blending timeless design with trendy accents, you can create a space that is both stylish and enduring,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistake #3: Overcrowding The Space With Furniture And Accessories\n\n“You never want to overstate the aesthetic of the room by having too much,” said Ron Renner, founder and president of Certified Interior Decorators International (C.I.D.). “Keep it simple with understatement in mind because too much decor, even beautiful decor, can cause stress and confusion.”\n\nSo how do you know if you have too much stuff in one room? If it’s difficult to move around without running into furniture or it looks cluttered when you enter, that is a good indication, Renner explained.\n\nIt’s also key to avoid overcrowding the space with certain colors and patterns. For example, using too many dark colors can make you feel tired or even depressed, he said. Also mixing a lot of different patterns can create chaos, Lunn added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s best to limit the number of patterns and find that perfect balance between solid colors and fun patterns,” she advised.\n\nMistake #4: Ignoring The Functionality Of A Piece\n\nWhen you’re looking to add a piece of furniture or other item to your home, it’s important to not only think about how it will look but also what purpose it will serve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMargarita Bravo, interior designer, decorator and owner of her own design studio, explains her thought process when selecting a new piece.\n\n“For example, [for] something as simple as the living room sofa … I want to make sure that it’s comfortable, that it has the right back support [and] that it … fits the entire family,” she said. “Also I want it to be high-performance, so it’s easy to clean and will last.”\n\nAfter considering the functionality and durability, she also checks that it reflects her style and personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistake #5: Underthinking Lighting Options\n\nFrom light fixtures and floor lamps to candles and string lights, there are so many lighting options when it comes to decorating your indoor and outdoor areas.\n\nRaquel Renner, a certified interior decorator and director of membership for C.I.D., said she avoids relying on traditional or standard lighting in her own home.\n\n“Unique lighting fixtures, much like a unique piece of artwork or furniture, add a pleasing aesthetic to a room’s ambiance … beyond just simply providing light,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, she loves the feel of a chandelier in a kitchen or bathroom or a beautiful pendant light (a single light fixture that hangs from the ceiling) over a nightstand instead of a typical lamp.\n\nMistake #6: Focusing On How Your Space ‘Should’ Look\n\nA common mistake when decorating is playing it safe and just replicating what you’ve seen at your friends’ houses or trends you’ve seen online, said Holly Hickey Moore, an interior designer, decorator and owner of Holly Hickey Moore Design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "If you’re guilty of putting too much thought into how many exclamation points you include in your work emails, you’re hardly alone.\n\nOn TikTok and Instagram, a number of women are imagining what might happen if they threw out the niceties and started writing emails like a man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s 2024 - no more courtesy phrases, babes,” Kay Bray, a career coach, jokes in one viral clip that has over 210,000 views on TikTok. Reworking her email in the clip, she takes out the “No rush — just looking to stay in the loop,” and opts not to include the obligatory “Thanks so much!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaedeh Davami, a sixth year medical student, also made an “emailing like a man” TikTok video which went viral.\n\n“I created the video because, honestly, we’ve all been there,” she told HuffPost.\n\n“You know, rewriting an email five times just to make sure you sound ‘polite enough’ but not overly enthusiastic like you’re writing to your grandma.”\n\nDavami’s biggest “you’re doing too much” tendency? “Definitely writing ‘no worries’ when clearly there were some worries involved.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristel Cocoli, a software developer and tech content creator, created a similar video back in 2022.\n\n“I’ve noticed how overly polite and padded my emails could get, especially compared to the short, straight-to-the-point emails I get from my colleagues and collaborators,” she told HuffPost. “I thought, ‘What if I just edited out all the fluff and sounded more like them?’”\n\nThe video was “a lighthearted experiment to see how it’d feel if I ditched the exclamation points and endless ‘no worries!’ vibes.”\n\n@kristel_tech\n\nWhy waste time say lot word when few word do trick. #fyp #fypシ #tech #industry #techtok\n\n♬ original sound - ridewitemm\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe videos are all in good fun, but what isn’t fun is how women are unfairly judged for writing emails that are viewed as overly congenial.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication in 2006 found that “when elements of speech and writing are associated with female communication style, they tend to be described in negative terms.”\n\nFor instance, the researchers wrote, exclamation points, which tend to be used more by women than men in emails and texts, are seen as ’’markers of excitability:” a phrase that “implies instability and emotional randomness.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs unfair as it is, “There are different rules for men and women when it comes to any workplace interaction,” said Lois Frankel, the author of “Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office” and an executive coach of three decades.\n\n“Whereas a guy can use two lines and get away with it, in our society we expect women — even self-confident, assertive women — to round off the rough edges just a little or risk being put in the ‘bitchy’ category,” she said.\n\nThat said, the goal is not to write more like a man, she said, but to be more confident and get to the point so you’re not wasting your own time. Frankel’s recommendation is skip the fluff and instead start with a quick personal touch, give the reason you’re writing, and then no more than three to four sentences of bullet points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer example email?\n\nDoug, I hope you had a productive trip to Dallas. I wanted to touch base about the proposal we discussed earlier this month which you said you’d have to me no later than this morning.

She reminds her clients that you’re not annoying or “asking for too much” by simply trying to fulfill the duties of your role.\n\n“And actually, the shorter the email, the easier you make it for the receiver of the email to actually take action upon the request,” she told HuffPost. “By making your request more simple, the core of what is actually needed can shine through more clearly.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, you don’t have to forgo all friendlessness, reminds Cocoli, one of the women behind a viral TikTok video above.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paying-grandparents-babysit-grandchild_l_66e86e8ce4b06998fbec7523",
    "text": "Pam Barnes, a resident of Louisville, Ohio, watches her 3-year-old grandson 10 hours a day, four days a week. She loves being involved in her grandchild’s life, but being a full-time caregiver also comes with a price.\n\nBarnes had to quit a “good-paying” job as an office manager. Her daughter and son-in-law “knew I couldn’t do it for free” and agreed to pay her $50 a day as a result, Barnes said. She said talking with her family about getting paid was “a little awkward,” but she sees this money as a sign of appreciation for the career sacrifice she has made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m not looking to replace my other salary, but I did need something, so [my husband and I] could have a little cushion,” Barnes said. “I also take [my grandson] places and out to lunch occasionally and use my pay for that.”\n\n“I didn’t want to cheat them or take too much from them. But they needed to understand that when you have kids, there’s expenses,” Barnes added. “You can’t expect your parents, friends ― whoever might want to do it ― you can’t expect them to do things for nothing.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, many Americans do have the expectation that grandparents should take care of grandchildren at any time, under any circumstance, for free.\n\n“One time, my daughter-in-law told [her] older friend that they paid me and [that friend] couldn’t believe that I took money,” said Janis Bowlby, a retired HR professional based in Newberg, Oregon. “It really hurt my feelings that someone would say that.”\n\nBowlby took care of her two grandchildren for $75 a week until the grandchildren went to school and her full-time care was no longer needed. Her family provided lunch, and Bowlby did not need gas money since she lived within a mile of her grandchildren. But as a widow, Bowlby said the money made a difference.\n\nIf you want to guarantee a hot debate, ask your friends and loved ones the following question: Should a grandparent be paid for taking care of their grandchild?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe perennially polarizing question is like kicking a hornet’s nest because it hits so many sore spots for American families around money or cultural expectations of what a grandparent should do.\n\nWhen HuffPost surveyed its readers about whether grandparents should be paid for babysitting grandchildren, one grandparent said, “My payment is every hug and kiss that I can get from them.” Another reader answered that the notion of paying her parents for child care “would be offensive and even comical” because “children for them are viewed as a treasure and a joy, not a job.”\n\nThe resentment that might be simmering underneath all of this? The idea that, if a grandparent really cares about their grandchildren and their adult children, they step up and take care of their grandchildren for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What if Grandma and Grandpa can’t afford to or simply don’t want to do this help for free?”\n\n“There are many grown children who, the minute a parent says no to anything, thinks, ‘They don’t love me,’” said Jane Isay, a grandparent and the author of “Walking on Eggshells: Navigating the Delicate Relationship Between Adult Children and Parents.”\n\nBowlby said she takes personal offense to people who are proud of parents who refuse to take money “because they love their grandkids.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If my children could not have afforded daycare, I would have still been there in a heartbeat because I love my children and grandchildren,” Bowlby said. “But they could, and at the time, the extra money helped me out.”\n\nOne big reason why many parents turn to their parents for child care duties is because day care is so unaffordable for many Americans. The market rate price for just one child per year can range from $5,357 in smaller towns to more than $17,000 in 2022 for larger cities, according to a 2023 Labor Department report across 2,360 U.S. counties in 47 states.\n\nThese prices represent up to 19.3% of a median American family’s income per child and are the reason why “childcare prices are untenable for families across all care types, age groups, and county population sizes,” the report stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this month, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance suggested that one solution for lowering the cost of day care lies with grandparents: “One of the ways you might be able to relieve a little bit of pressure on people who are paying so much for day care is ... maybe Grandma and Grandpa wants to help out a little bit more.”\n\nBut what if Grandma and Grandpa can’t afford to, or simply don’t want to do this help for free?\n\nAs Audrey VanScyoc, a parent in Tucson, Arizona, put it to HuffPost: “Money is tight for everyone right now, including grandparents. They may not want to take money for babysitting their grandkids, but they should,” she said.\n\nIf these U.S. families lived in Sweden, all of these questions would not need to be so personal. The decision on whether or not to pay grandparents would not have to be a fraught discussion between families ― it would be government policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Sweden’s trailblazing law, grandparents can get paid for taking care of grandchildren.\n\nAs of July, Swedish grandparents are eligible for up to three months of paid parental leave for a grandchild’s first year. Under the new law, parents can transfer a maximum of 45 days from the Nordic country’s generous paid leave policy to a grandparent, while a single parent can transfer 90 days, which will help a grandparent “strengthen the ties to their grandchild,” said Anna Tenje, minister for older people and social insurance in Sweden.\n\nTenje told HuffPost that the new law will particularly benefit single mothers and families in which several adults are involved in raising children. She said the ability to transfer paid parental leave to grandparents “increases the possibility for parents of young children to combine working life with family life in periods of life that require more flexibility.”\n\nCould this ever happen in the U.S., which remains one of the few countries in the world without any form of national paid leave? Not anytime soon, said Richard Petts, a professor of sociology at Ball State University and an expert on parental leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the U.S., “our childcare infrastructure is quite poor, and we don’t subsidize childcare nearly to the extent we should ― families are expected to manage this themselves and not be supported by public policies,” he said. Adopting Sweden’s paid caregiver model would require Americans to value care much more than they currently do, he said.\n\nAlthough the Nordic country’s grandparent leave remains a far-off fantasy for Americans, it’s the kind of law that could help make paying a grandparent for child care a less judgmental conversation.\n\n“Policies that recognize the value of carework would certainly help to de-stigmatize various forms of compensation for this labor,” Petts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. grandparents, for one, would welcome the idea. “I think Sweden is on to something,” Bowlby said. “It would be a great way to earn a little extra and give us an opportunity to fill a need.”\n\nHow to talk about paying a grandparent without making it awkward and tense for everyone.\n\nUntil there is nationwide change, the conversation about whether to pay a grandparent for caregiving will continue to be a sensitive topic for U.S. families. But it doesn’t have to be such a contentious debate ― if both sides are willing to table their assumptions.\n\n“This arrangement cannot be made out of anger. ‘Well, I’ll pay you,’” Isay said. “It requires a lack of ego on both sides.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLose the harmful and judgmental belief that if grandparents want or need to be paid, it means they love their grandchildren ― or their adult child ― less.\n\n“My feeling is that if you donate your time to your grandchildren or you are paid, you are doing it out of love,” Bowlby said.\n\nInstead, grandparents should be direct about what this money could do to help them, and adult children can be proactive about offering ways to reimburse their parent for their time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s not about, ‘Oh, you can’t love me if you need the money,’” Isay said. “It’s, ‘How can we make this easy for everybody? How could we make it so that we’re sharing the children and the love and the sacrifice?’”\n\nFamilies can use the cost of child care in their area as a starting measure for how much they should pay a grandparent. Bowlby said in her own talks with family, “I told them to find out how much it would cost if they had to pay a child care facility, and I would charge them one-third of that cost,” she said.\n\nReimbursement also does not have to be a regular check to be meaningful. Bowlby, who still drives her youngest grandchild around, said her family gave her the surprise gift of $500 spending money on a cruise as a way to thank her. “They still tell me constantly how much they appreciated what I did and how they needed me,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It's not about, 'Oh, you can't love me if you need the money.'”\n\nAdult children who want to compensate grandparents should also be sensitive about whether their offer of payment might be a blow to their parent’s ego. So if you want your parent to accept the money, be respectful.\n\n“As grandparents age, our authority leaks out like a hole in one of the water towers. It’s like drip, drip, drip,” Isay said. “And taking money from your children to take care of the grandchildren might be an assault on that authority.“\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor both parents and grandparents, it helps to tune out the noise of what other people expect you to do for caregiving. Many people also hold entrenched ideas of what a grandparent should be doing with their free time, which contributes to the ongoing stigma against paying grandparents for caregiving.\n\nFor adult children, it helps to remember that it is not realistic to keep your parent constantly on reserve for free babysitting duties ― unless this is an explicit agreement you both have accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most important piece of advice is to have the conversation. Barnes, for example, said she and her daughter talked for almost a year before Barnes quit her job about what her caregiver role could look like. Now that it’s her reality, Barnes sometimes wishes she could just be Nana instead of her grandchild’s disciplinarian, but she said the good days outweigh her bad ones.\n\n“When he tells [me], ‘Nana, I have so much fun with you,’ that outweighs the ‘Nana, I don’t want to do what you tell me right now,’” Barnes said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, as Barnes’ story shows, the decision about when to accept payment can be nuanced. Barnes decided that when she watches her grandchild over the occasional weekend, she does not ask for payment, because it’s when she and her husband “can be Nana and Papa” and just have fun.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

    "text": "Donald Trump’s Wild Golf Brag Amid Tariffs Panic Sparks Outrage Online\n\nThe president was slammed on social media over the “let them eat cake” moment.\n\nLOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nCritics took a swing at Donald Trump this weekend for hitting the golf course amid economic uncertainty caused by his imminent tariffs on countries worldwide.\n\nWhile fears of a global recession mounted and stock markets slid, Trump spent the weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, participating in the Senior Club Championship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump boasted about his performance on the links.\n\nAsked by a reporter how the tournament had gone, he said: “Very good, because I won.”\n\n“It’s good to win. You heard I won? Did you hear I won? Just to back it up, there ― I won. I like to win,” he added.\n\nWhen asked about his golf handicap, Trump responded, “Very low. I have a very low handicap.”\n\nThen, he said: “OK, let’s go,” and moved on to other questions from the press.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump on the golf course “may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency ― the president out on a golf cart while people’s retirement is in flames.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It will be the Trump Recession,” Schiff predicted, should the economy take a terrible tumble. “He will completely own it.”\n\nCritics on social media were unimpressed by Trump’s boasts and with the timing of his golfing, which also came at the expense of attending a ceremony honoring the return of the bodies of four U.S. soldiers who died in a training exercise in Lithuania last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.
