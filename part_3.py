"""My Question/Issue:"""

# this is my code: with open('poke_glitch.pickle','r') as g:     reloaded_copy_of_texts1 = pickle.load(g)

# It produces the following error: typeerror: write() argument must be str, not bytes


"""ChatGPT's Response:"""

# The error message you're seeing, "TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes," is occurring because you're trying to open the file 'poke_glitch.pickle' in text mode ('r' for read), but it appears that the file was written in binary mode. In Python, when you open a file in text mode ('r'), the data read from the file is expected to be in string format, but if the file was written in binary mode, you should open it in binary mode ('rb') to correctly read the data.

# Here's how you can modify your code to open the file in binary mode and load the data using the 'rb' mode:

# ```python
# import pickle

# with open('poke_glitch.pickle', 'rb') as g:
#     reloaded_copy_of_texts1 = pickle.load(g)
# ```

# By using 'rb' mode, you will be able to correctly read the binary data from the file and deserialize it using `pickle.load()`.
