How I Used AI Tools

Throughout this text-analysis project, I used ChatGPT to help me brainstorm how to approach this homework and to clarify program concepts, debug errors, and explore advanced code.

Main topics and PART OF questions I asked:

Brainstorm steps to do
I pasted the instruction in the chat and asked, “brainstorm the steps for me, I am currently learning ThinkPython and how can I approach this homework.”

Data cleaning and preprocessing
“How can I clean raw text by removing control characters, punctuation, and special symbols using unicodedata?”

Learning outcome: I learned to identify non-letter characters with unicodedata.category(), replace them with spaces, and remove empty lines using strip() and conditional checks.

Stop-word removal
“How do I build a stop-word filter using only loops and lists, similar to Think Python examples?”

Learning outcome: I practiced writing a remove_stopwords() function with a simple for loop and if word not in stoplist, reinforcing list processing concepts without relying on external libraries.

Word-frequency analysis and ASCII visualization
“Why did my ASCII bar-chart show nothing, and how can I fix it?”

Learning outcome: I discovered how to verify that the frequency dictionary isn’t empty, handle normalization so bars have visible length, and print ranked results correctly.

Markov text synthesis (advanced technique)
“What does each part of the Markov-chain code do, and how can I integrate it into my own project?”

Learning outcome: I learned how a Markov model stores word transitions in a dictionary of tuples, how to randomly generate realistic text using those probabilities, and why sliding windows and random seeds are used.

Code explanation and verification
“Please explain what each function and loop does so I fully understand the logic.”

Learning outcome: I reviewed every function line-by-line, confirming my comprehension before testing, which aligns with the instruction to verify and validate all AI-generated code.

Testing and validation
After each interaction, I copied the suggested code into my environment, executed it, and observed the output to confirm correctness.
For example:

I printed sample dictionary entries from the Markov table to check that successors looked reasonable.

I compared cleaned text previews and word-frequency counts before and after applying each new function.

This testing ensured that every piece of AI-assisted code met my project requirements and that I fully understood its operation.

Sentiment analysis
“How can I design a simple sentiment analysis without external libraries, using only regex and dictionary logic?”

Learning outcome: I learned to build a small custom sentiment lexicon with positive and negative word values, create a negation list, and calculate sentiment scores by summing word values within each sentence. ChatGPT also guided me to split sentences using regular expressions, tokenize words, and apply a rolling mean function to smooth sentiment trends. Through this, I practiced dictionary lookups, loops, and conditionals from ThinkPython in a real text-analysis context, and I understood how my sentiment output (showing slight positivity in Jane Eyre) connects to the book’s emotional tone.
