Initial thoughts for Project:

Use several apis
    -I have applied to twitters dveloper platform asking for use of their api for sentiment analysis
    -I also plan on using wikipedias api for general information on cpi and yeild curves
    -maybe use yahoofinance api but it seems like its underdevelopment https://python-yahoofinance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
    -finnhub python for stock price


use wiki for general information introducing cpi and interestrates

then use the news api to bring in news data on cpi releses and powel comments

perform sentiment analysis on news reports

use yahoo finance api to calculate 5,10,20 day moving averages for the s&p 500 as an overall benchmark for the economy
    could use data visualization techniques

Depending on news i will have statments that say
    -good news, good trend - then print (hold rating)
    -good news, bad trend - then print (buy rating)
    - bad news, good trend - (sell)
    - bad news, bad trend - (sell)
