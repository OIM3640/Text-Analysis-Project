The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort.

It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series!

Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.

The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!

There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are.

The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.

For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo.

I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.

But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever

Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books.

Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development.

I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.

It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back.

I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.

I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule.

They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.

Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire.

I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better.

Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters.

This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes.

This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!

This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10

You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.

And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.

The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death).

Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.

There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.

The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.

By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too.

She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)

Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.

Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire.

I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better.

Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters.

This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes.

This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!

This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10

You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.

And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.

The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death).

Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.

There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.

The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.

By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too.

She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)

Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.

Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire.

I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better.

Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters.

This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes.

This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!

This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10

You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.

And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.

The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death).

Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.

There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.

The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.

By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too.

She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.

It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)

Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.

Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes. I can almost safely guarantee anyone who likes vampires and horror (and a lot of dry wit) will not be disappointed.
Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3. Seems like a cliche show. But dang it's good.Let yourself get past the first few eps and it only gets better from there. It's no wonder it's been the number one show in many regions for such long periods of time.Spectacular writing (in the first 3 seasons at least). More story in one episode than most show have in 3.

It is one of the best teen drama present till date featuring all kind of emotions in one. The plot is just amazing and the music supporting the scenes makes the emotions more expressible. The perfect cast for all perfect characters. This show is gonna live in our hearts for a really long time. #tvdforever
When I decided to watch this series, I was told that it was similar to "Twilight", and that sounded an alert in my head. In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, cliché and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.At a technical level, the series has few flaws. Good production values, good special effects, visual and sound, a nice CGI that, despite everything, seems fake at times, good scenarios and costumes, especially in the period scenes, and also a very good soundtrack, full of good songs that are in the ear.
This show was legit, the best I could possibly imagine. I was hesitant for the first few years and once I started watching, I was hooked. Whoever was in charge of the music for the scenes, deserves so much credit. Each song fit each scene PERFECTLY! You truly felt connected and felt the emotions of the scenes. I'm on my third time watching the entire series and each time I learn new things I missed watching it prior. If only you could do a spin-off with all the original characters, that would be amazing. With Stefan gone though, it wouldn't seem right. The ending was truly epic, I haven't cried that hard in a long time.
This show is absolutely amazing! I am a guy which may be a little weird, but this show is actually really good! It is bloody good fun, :) and is great at keeping you locked into it! I love the whole vampire plot and stuff, because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing! The "Scream" series writer doing a TV show?! Count me in! I love the characters, too! My favorites are Damon, Mr. Saltzman, and Elena! Stefan scares me, but Hahaha whatever! I also love watching promos for upcoming episodes because all I do is smile and think to myself, "Why can't it be now???!!!" Hahaha but the only thing that is bad is the schedule. Thursday night TV is a very crowded night for me and a LOT of people. The Office, 30 Rock, The Mentalist, Parks and Recreation, Community, Sports... It is great to fit Vampire Diaries in, because I would clear my whole schedule for it hahaha :) I want this show to be kept on the air for years :)
I avoided TVD for six seasons. I read the original books as a young teen and never really cared for that version of Elena. Thought she was a b*tch. One day while laid up in bed I decided to give a couple episodes a try, next thing I know I've binged through 6 seasons in an undisclosed amount of time. Seriously I can't explain what that does to a person's brain or the amount of reintegration required to get back to civilization. Anyways the show was heartfelt, funny, irritating, intriguing etc. It was definitely odd to hear someone being called a "Dick" every episode if not multiple times as if there was nothing else in the universe you could call someone. Oh that's right it's the CW. Loved Damon's cocky loose cannon but big softy way down deep character and I actually liked Elena for the most part. Not positive why everyone hates her. And can't forget Caroline, that was some great character development. I haven't bothered watching season 7 and probably won't until the show finally ends and I know Elena will be back for at least the series finally. I need to know I'll have closure on the whole delena thing before I commit to more seasons. For me the story was about her and now that she's gone it's just not the same.
Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.The script is fabulous; full of exciting and unpredictable plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat and gasping; desperately wanting to see the next episode.Unfortunately, it's judged by the title; "vampire" and dismissed, but I urge you to give this show a chance.
This show is just amazing. It's so different and original. I love the cast, they do an amazing job of portraying their characters. Especially Nina Dobrev who has literally played like six different characters. Every year the show gets better. You watch the first season and think, "It cannot get any better", and then Season 2 comes and proves you wrong. It does that every year, pretty much. I think my favorite seasons are 2 and 4, because I love Katherine and I love the Originals and when Elena becomes a vampire. Katherine and Elena are definitely my favorite characters. This show centers around Elena Gilbert. She falls in love with Stefan, who turns out to be a vampire. Then his murderous vampire brother, Damon, comes and she falls in love with him. Throughout the show we meet witches, werewolves, Original vampires, immortals who aren't vampires, vampire-witches, and nearly everything you could think of.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.
The Vampire surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 171 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This show offers so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. The plot, character development, basically everything about this show is what makes this stand out as one of the best supernatural shows of all-time.
I thought The Vampire Diaries was going to be a show aimed for tweens but I was wrong. It started off that way for the first half of Season 1 but around episode 10 or 11 it really picked up and got better and better. I was ready to give up a few episodes in because it looked like the tv version of Twilight buy I read to get passed the first handful of episodes and I'm so glad I did. It turns into a really good supernatural show and has a great rating for a reason! If you like supernatural type shows then I highly recommend this for you, just get passed the first half of Season1.
This is no doubt one of my FAVORITE shows of all time. I can't believe that it's over! I will definitely miss my weekly doses of Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Enzo and Alaric and Matt! I would like to thank the whole cast for giving us one of the most amazing, gripping, unbelievably FANTASTIC shows ever to be made.
Although this isn't my favourite show, it definitely comes close. I have to say I do think they kept using the same ideas over and over and just added new people but it does work. It's like there will be a problem with a vampire needing a cure and then the most powerful vampire ever is the obstacle in the way of the cure, they somehow manage to get around that vampire and then they have the cure but oh no something else happens that takes the cure away again!! That just felt repetitive. It was problem after problem after problem and the problems were just all too similar. I do love the acting and I do love the characters but I just wish they tried harder to make more interesting stories and adventures to go with them. This had so much potential and had they had been more creative, I could see this series going for another 2 series. Also I don't like how they brought Elena back. It sort of felt too simple to be the end of the vampire diaries as this series is known for its drama and twists and turns. It just didn't feel like it got the ending it deserved. It sort of felt like they skipped important moments and they could have done something to bring others back so that we could actually see the happy ending they deserved. Whereas instead we just see the afterlife really and that doesn't feel good enough for the Vampire Diaries given its long seasons too. I would love to watch the whole thing again but instead I'll be skipping the last episode and pretending something else happened instead.
Probably the first ever book to show adaptation I've watched where the show was better the books. I was late on the TVD bandwagon because I couldn't even get through the books they were so boring but imagine my surprise when the show was the complete opposite. I loved all the characters and casting was great! The characters are really what make this show so enjoyable. There was so much chemistry in all the relationships and friendships I really felt it.SPOILERS!The biggest fail of this show was Caroline and Klaus not ending up together.Not to mention Bonnie and Damon having so much chemistry during and after the prison world.And we all needed more Kai Parker.I'm not really a fan of how it all ended but still a show I can watch repeatedly.
This TV show is one of my favorites because first, I'm a fantasy genre lover along with romance and this show got every detail about it and I loved it. The thing about it is that even the details mentioned in the first episode are re-announced in the progression of the show and this means that not a single detail can't be important, everything is used in the next episodes. I personally, loved the progression in time that they have done by moving you sometimes to the past to explain an idea and they did it perfectly in a way that keeps it interesting. In the past shows I have watched, I usually hated the transition between the past and present where I get all messed up, but in The Vampire Diaries it's just amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature such as vampires, werewolves, witches, hybrids, and much much more without forgetting the drama/romance and action/fantasy in every scene.In conclusion, I totally recommend it for every teenager especially because I believe that it's perfect for a fifteen to eighteen years.And for I must not forget the comparison between Twilight saga and The Vampire Diaries and this is my personal opinion that Twilight is the one that made The Vampire Diaries get that fame because when Twilight started, the love to vampires started then so it's no way to compare anything to Twilight as it's for me the boss of all the vampires movies and shows. And let's not forget that movies can't have all to all details like series which is an advantage for The Vampire Diaries. But if you are a Twilight fan, then The Vampire Diaries is for you!
This is my favorite TV show, ever. Superbly cast, the story is centered around Elaina Gilbert and brothers Stephan and Damen Salvatore in the city of Mystic Falls. Elaina and her brother, Jeremy have been orphaned and now live in their home with their aunt Jenna. There have been animal attacks.The show is so well-written I think it is better than the books. There are vampires and werewolves and Originals and hybrids and doppelgangers and hunters. The show can be intense. Even scary, so you may find yourself enjoying moments of respite. Enjoy them. They won't last long. I am so disappointed with the mess being made of Vampire Academy, I am rewatching this show. It remains my favorite and is immensely rewatchable.
I'll keep this short... Just finished this series on Netflix today, I'm not an individual who gets sad easily, or finds empathy in things, but the final episode of this show made me cry like a newborn baby. Overall, best TV series I've watched by far, incredible script, and incredible actors.
This centers around the brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore and both their mutual friendship and animosity. At the same time they're tangled up with the human Elena.What ruins it is the sudden merging of Caroline and Stefan. They have no chemistry and it just makes no sense to make them fall for one another. It's so forced. She was much more suited for Tyler, they had amazing chemistry and they were a team. Then there's the character of Silas who I couldn't place in the story.Lily was one of the best characters and she was killed off so soon for some reason, the same with Mary Louise and her girlfriend. Why did so many interesting characters just disappear?What makes it exciting is the tension, the witches, the magic and when the vampires flip their humanity switch. However if you want a truly quality show about vampires with great acting and a beautiful story then watch 'True Blood.'
It was very beautiful and lovely. Thank you for all the actors as well as the director, I am saddened by this beautiful collection but left good memories for.
I never watched this back in the day cause i thought of it as a "girls" show. Man was a wrong. I got so addicted to this, i would watch an entire season in 1 day(22 episodes) every episode kept me saying "1 more" when it ended. The characters were fantastic, had great development, fantastic writing(as a loved a lot of the dialogue from the Mickelsons) and were just overall badasses. Season 4 was my favorite(ive never had a favorite season in a show) and to me is very memorable and emotional. By maybe mid season 6 I was starting to feel a little meh about it, but the introduction of Rayna Cruz in season 7 reignited my addiction.Through out the show i flip flopped between stefan and damon being my favorite characters... in the end both were great, but damon had a HUGE character development which i really liked. He isn't the only one though... KLAUS was someone who I truly despised when he was introduced but man he became such a fantastic villian of sorts by the time we last see him. This show opened my eyes to me actually liking villians. This show has a lot of loyalty which is one of my favorite thing and it shows when it comes to the Mickelsons. For example with rebekah no matter how many times she was staked my her own blood she always had his back, but she was one of the lesser evils(the other being elijah) and was the first to want to change her life for the better thanks to Matt. Bonnie was another badass who I loved as well as her lover, Enzo. The moment I started liking Enzo was when him and damon were under the spell from the siren, but Enzo was fighting it with all his will and might and that showed true character and courage which drew me in.The characters I hated most were ki finn and kol.During season 4 i balled my eyes out when alaric died and damon was sitting there and missing him while drinking. And alaric said "i miss you to buddy"., when elena broke down after losing jeremy, and when she turned her humanity off oh man when that happened i couldnt sleep and no show has done that to me. I never realised just how pure and amazing her humanity was until we saw how she acted when it was off, and when damon finally got her to turn it back on i cried yet again but this time they were happy tears!.This show had a satisfying ending for me.
This is a breathtaking TV-series. I am only bothered by one thing, and that is why Julie Plec (TV-Series Creator) & Kevin Williamson takes more plot lines from the Books? This would have made the series a 20 out of 10. The book series is even greater then the show, so I can just imagine.I will not give any of you any spoilers, this is just a must watch, spoilers doesn't even spoil. You must see it to understand it. For those of you who doesn't like Vampires. I have 5 friends whom hated Vampires up until they started to watch this TV-series (brought on them by me). It's like no other, and the show deserves more than it's getting. No Golden or Emmy nominations (yet). It truly deserves it though. THE best Vampire TV-show to date! Better than Buffy, better than Charmed, better than Smallville and better than most supernatural series! Watch it NOW!Great actors, a thrilling feeling in every episode with a comedic touch, what more can you ask for in a TV-Show really? Fantastic is what it is!
Damon has the best chemistry with everyone. Ian Somerhalder (Damon) is the star of the show and should be expanded, along with Nina Dobrev as Elena.Damon and Stephan are both great characters. Damon's emotion is most true, intense and believable. His relationship with Elena as opposed to Stephans seems more authentic and has the greatest potential.Vampire Diaries has taken me by surprise. It is a great show with great characters. I was disinterested at first because it seemed like a cheesy high school soap opera with vampires or a wannabe Twilight. They have definitely proved me wrong. Damon's character has exceeded my expectations and surpassed similar characters on other series by far.
Even though this Series ended in 2017. Fans are still watching and obsessed with all the characters that make this show still one of the most watched Series in the world. And here we are 2021 watching on Netflix.
This is my favorite of the CW lineup now and the my pick for the best of the supernatural & vampire shows out there. The cast is super attractive and there is lots of excitement each week.I am a Twilight fan but when I first started watching this I thought it was a pale imitation of Twilight but it improved a lot during the first season. I gave it another chance and now I am hooked. There are inevitable comparisons to Twilight. Actually they are quite different and you can like both in different ways. First of all the Vampire Diaries books came out years before Twilight. So it's not a copy in fact it's the other way round. It's more sexy and has more violence and fighting. The main character Elena is a much stronger and more modern woman than Bella Swan. She isn't ready to give up everything to be with her Edward.Compared to the other supernatural and vampire shows, this is the most fun. The True Blood cast is a bit old and isn't pretty enough. Supernatural is a bit repetitive and too dark.There's lots of plot every episode - maybe a bit too much melodrama sometimes. It's always nicely filmed. The historical flashbacks are well done.The cast is watchable and attractive (much more so than True Blood). Nina Dobrev is a good actress who plays the 2 parts of Elena and Katherine very well. Her exotic Eastern European looks distinguish her from other actresses her age. Candace Accola as Caroline is good playing it sweet and silly. Kat Graham as Bonnie the good witch as is intelligent looking. Paul Wesley as Stefan is no R Patz but he is quite beastly looking and acts well. Ian Somerhalder as Damon looks the part even if he hams it up a bit too much. The triangle is more complex than Bella Edward Jacob. The humans Matthew Davis as Alaric and Steven R Mcqueen as Jeremy are quite sympathetic. Michael Trevino as Tyler is quite a good werewolf. The supporting characters that come in and out are well cast eg Kelly Hu as Pearl, Malese Jow as Anna and Paul Morgan as Klaus.Hope Vampire Diaries lasts many seasons. It's exciting and the best guilty pleasure on TV right now.
First Impression: Oh this is just some Twilight rip off.The Truth: Twilight is the one ripping off THIS series.The Absolute Truth: The Vampire Diaries is infinitely better than Twilight, and no I am not exaggerating.The plot is as you would have guessed. Elena (Nina Dobrev) is a high school girl who captures the heart of Stefan (Paul Wesley) who of course is a vampire (sounds familiar right?). Later on we get introduced to Stefan's troublesome vampire brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Damon also happens to be attracted to Elena and this creates a love triangle that will follow for the remainder of the series.Of course that's merely a sample of the entire story. There are werewolves, hunters, witches, and even stronger vampires waiting in future episodes to make this one nail biting show.The acting is also definitely above average, however obviously not enough to make you believe the actors are high school "teenagers".My advice: Give it a chance. The first few episodes are slow, but a lot of great TV series are. This show will have you on the edge of your seat each week as the plot thickens more and more.Last Impression: This is one of my favorite shows on TV. 9/10
When I tuned in to "The Vampire Diaries" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, "Supernatural." I'd seen (and read) the "Twilight" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original "The Vampire Diaries" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in "The Vampire Diaries." This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire.
