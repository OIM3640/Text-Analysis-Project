# Project Writeup and Reflection

## Overview
The project used two data sources, the reviews for two popular TV shows, Stranger Things and Vampire Diaries, scraped from the IMDb website. The analysis included two techniques, recommendation analysis, and Markov model text generation. The recommendation analysis involved identifying the most frequent words, running sentiment analysis to determine the recommendability of the shows and analyze text similarity. The Markov model text generation was used to generate new reviews based on the scraped reviews. The project aimed to compare the similarities and differences between the two shows, so as to give some insights to the audience. Additionally, the project hoped to learn about the effectiveness of using natural language processing techniques in analyzing and generating reviews.

## Implementation
The implementation process involves three main phases: text file buildup, recommendation analysis, and review regeneration. In the text file buildup phase, reviews are scraped from the IMDb website, which involves obtaining the URL and parsing the content. The data is then cleaned and stored in a text file. The recommendation analysis phase includes two approaches: analyze_sentiment() and is_show_recommended(). analyze_sentiment() calculates the average sentiment score of the words in the text file, while is_show_recommended() reads a file containing reviews of a TV show and determines whether the show is recommended based on the majority sentiment of the reviews. Both approaches use the VADER sentiment analyzer, but is_show_recommended() takes into account the overall sentiment of a collection of reviews. After that, a text analysis will be ran to assess the similarity of the two reviews(note: only 50 lines of each review is read, so as to avoid crushing terminals). In the review regeneration phase, a Markov model is generated using the generate_markov_model() function, and new reviews are generated using the generate_text() function. The Markov model is built by calculating the conditional probabilities of each word given its preceding words. The generate_text() function chooses a random starting prefix from the model and then randomly selects a suffix based on its transition probabilities. The resulting text will have a similar style and structure to the original text, but with some variation based on the probabilities of the Markov model.

A design decision was made in the recommendation analysis phase to choose between analyze_sentiment() and is_show_recommended(). While analyze_sentiment() only considers the sentiment of individual words, is_show_recommended() takes into account the overall sentiment of a collection of reviews, and thus is the preferred approach for making a recommendation based on the overall sentiment of the reviews. For analysis purposes, both functions will be run to double-check whether the show is recommended. Overall, the implementation involves using various algorithms and data structures, such as web scraping, sentiment analysis, Markov models, and text generation, to achieve the goal of analyzing and generating reviews. The different components are connected sequentially, with the output of one phase becoming the input of the next.

## Result
### Text Analysis 
As shown in the images\frequency_words.png, the most frequent words in the reviews of Stranger Things and Vampire Diaries offer insights into their respective focuses and themes. The reviews of both shows discuss them as a whole, with frequent use of words like "season," "show," and "series." Positive evaluations are reflected in words like "really," "great," and "good." The reviews also discuss the characters and their storylines, and consider the shows' structure and format with words like "TV" and "episode(s)." In addition, the frequent appearance of "vampire" in the Vampire Diaries review and "horror" in the Stranger Things review indicates a similarity in genre(horror fiction). Both reviews evaluate the shows' quality and discuss their style and genre elements, while focusing on characters and storylines. There are also some differences: the Stranger Things review seems to focus more on the show's plot and themes with the frequent use of "things" and "one," while the Vampire Diaries review seems to focus more on the show's characters with the frequent use of character names like "Damon" and "Elena." Nonetheless, both reviews offer valuable insights into their respective shows and help readers to understand their themes, focus, and quality. Throughout the process, ChatGPT helps me with acquiring new packages and gives me examples that guide me to learn. The screenshots showing how this magic AI tool helps are stored in the following paths: images\scrape_review_with_chatgpt.png; images\markov_model_with_chatgpt.png.

As shown in the images\recommendation_analysis.png, both Stranger Things and Vampire Diaries are recommended by the analyze_sentiment() function with average scores of 0.036 and 0.045 respectively, indicating that both shows generally have positive reviews. In terms of audience recommendation, both shows are also recommended with similar ratios of positive to negative reviews (27:1 for Stranger Things and 24:1 for Vampire Diaries). However, there are some differences in the sentiment analysis of the two shows. The average score for Vampire Diaries is slightly higher, indicating that it may have slightly more positive reviews overall. In terms of text similarity(as shown in the images\text_similarity.png), the resulting scatter plot shows the positions of the 50 reviews from the two TV shows in a 2D space. When data points are clustered together in a scatter plot, it means that they share similarities. In this case, reviews that are closer to each other in the plot have similar content in the text. Since most data points form a cluster, we can see that the reviews for Stranger Things and Vampire Diaries are similar to each other. This leads us to conclude that the common themes and sentiments among the reviews for these two TV shows are similar, based on the sample analysis.

### Interesting 
The description of Stranger Things highlights the show's attention to detail in recreating the 1980s and the high level of quality in its writing, acting, and production value. The show is said to follow a group of friends as they uncover supernatural occurrences and government conspiracies throughout all four seasons. The review is filled with the show's creative and directorial aspects. On the other hand, the description of Vampire Diaries seems to focus more on the cast and the chemistry between them. The review praises the Vampire Diaries for its cast and attractive plot. Overall, the review has a positive opinion of Vampire Diaries, calling it "perfect for a really long time" and declaring their love for the show with "TVD forever." In summary, based on the regenerated text, both TV shows are strongly recommended.

-- Regenerated Text -- 
Here are the descriptions; The regenerated text does not include punctuations, therefore I manually added the punctuations. To avoid distorting the regenerated texts, I did not change too much of the descriptions and sentences might seem fragmented: 

Stranger Things: "Great evil is making itself known to the future. Neverending story, the thing. The wondrous thing is how dead on this tribute. It's still very good. In fact, now that I watch it season 1, I didn't get into what I believe Stranger Things has maintained an extremely high level of quality in its writing, acting, and production value. The show's attention to detail in recreating the 1980s and follows a group of friends as they uncover supernatural occurrences and government conspiracies throughout all four seasons so far. Duffer brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with"

Vampire Diaries: "Every teenager, especially because I think Kevin Williamson is amazing. The way they added every type of supernatural creature, such as the plot and stuff because I love the cast is watchable and attractive, much more suited for Tyler. They had amazing chemistry and it only gets better. The lesser evils, the other way round. It's no wonder it's perfect for a really long time. TVD forever. When I tuned in to the past and present where I get all messed up but in the next episode, unfortunately it's so different and you can like both in different"

## Reflection
From a process point of view, the recommendation analysis went well and contributed to an accurate test of whether the two shows are recommendable. The analysis of the reviews for Stranger Things and Vampire Diaries was conducted by identifying the 20 most frequent words and running a sentiment analysis. Based on these results, the similarities and differences between the two shows were concluded: while movie reviews focus on characters for Vampire Diaries, there are more reviews focusing on plots for Stranger Things. It is recommended that both shows are worth watching, although Vampire Diaries received slightly more positive attitudes overall. I believe the project is appropriately scoped since 100 pages of reviews were scraped and analyzed. However, the text regeneration process could be improved, as the resulting text contained many fragmented sentences and incomplete thoughts. Future iterations of this analysis could benefit from a more rigorous approach to text generation, such as using machine learning algorithms to generate more coherent and natural language text.

From a learning perspective, I have learned a lot about data analysis and text generation techniques, including how to scrape data from websites, clean and filter the data to remove irrelevant information, and use various analytical methods to gain insights from the data. I have also learned how to generate coherent and readable text by leveraging the power of AI language models like ChatGPT. By asking ChatGPT to give me examples of the usage of new models/packages, I was able to learn from imitation and follow a steep learning curve. Looking ahead, I aim to leverage what I have learned in this project to generate well-articulated film reviews with complete sentences, humanized styles, and insightful content. By applying the skills I have developed, I am confident that I will be able to create high-quality content that is both engaging and informative. In retrospect, one thing that would have helped me succeed even more in this project is having a more comprehensive understanding of web scraping and data cleaning techniques beforehand. With a deeper understanding of these methods, I would have been able to hit the ground running more quickly and dedicate more time to focusing on the more advanced aspects of the project. However, by utilizing ChatGPT and other resources, I was able to learn these skills quickly and achieve my goals effectively.
