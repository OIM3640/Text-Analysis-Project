# Text-Analysis-Project
 

1. **Project Overview** 
   -
   For my project, I used the NewsAPI to fetch news articles related to "Apple Growth". The goal was to process these articles and perform sentiment analysis using NLTK to gauge the overall sentiment in these articles, which could help provide some market/company insights. I aimed to understand the general public sentiment regarding Apple's growth by analyzing the news content. To achieve this, I utilized text processing techniques to clean the data and then applied sentiment analysis using natural language processing tool to get an insight into how positive, negative, or neutral the news articles' sentiments were in the past week.
   
2. **Implementation**
   -
   At an architectural level, my system consisted of several key components. Firstly, the NewsAPI served as the data source, providing news articles related to "Apple Growth." Secondly, I utilized NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis to process the text content after cleaning it by removing special characters and stopwords. An important design decision involved merging the titles and descriptions for overall sentiment analysis. This choice aimed to provide a holistic understanding of the sentiments expressed in the entire content. Chatgpt provided me guidance on how to use NLTK sentiment analysis through explained steps and examples, providing me understanding about this tool during the implementation process.

3. **Results**
   -
   For the sentiment analysis conducted on the news articles related to "Apple Growth," the predominant result was an overall neutral sentiment. The sentiment scores generated by the sentiment analysis concludes a neutral sentiment with a score of 1.0 for each article, as shown in the image below.

   While the overall neutral sentiment could indicate a lack of extreme sentiments in the news articles, it could also underline a potential challenge in accurately capturing sentiment from the content through the specific processing methods employed. The result could be potentially imrpoved by reassessing the text preprocessing, exploring other sentiment analysis tools, or conducting a deeper analysis into the nature and context of the articles to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. This experience underscores the importance of refining the analysis process and considering alternative techniques to ensure a more insightful and accurate result. 
4. **Reflection**
   -
   The project allowed me to grasp a good understanding of how to retrieve data using API and conduct the text analysis in a effective structure. However, I could improve the handling of potential errors that might occur during data processing, enhancing the accuracy of the outcome. Overall, I learned a lot about text processing, natural language processing tools, and using external APIs for data collection. ChatGPT's resources were helpful in building the strucures and guiding my understanding of text analysis methods. It's also a essential debugging tool for me throughout the process. By asking Chatgpt on how I can improve my certain lines of code, I am able to learn different ways of implementing the method.
   
   Looking forward, I aim to refine error handling and incorporate better visualization techniques for more comprehensive insights. I also find the practice of writing separate functions to be benefical as it allows me to break down the structure of my code into smaller segments. I wish I had a better testing plan initially to account for potential issues and ensure smoother execution. For example, I was stuggling to combine the article title and description to performe an overall sentment analysis, which could've been avoided by joining the data at an ealier stage. Overall, the project provided a solid foundation for future explorations in API and text analysis.
