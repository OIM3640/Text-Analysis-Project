# Text-Analysis-Project
 
Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

Process
# The first step in the process was to figure out which text I wanted to analyze.
# At first, I was interested in tweets by famous individuals, such as Elon Musk,
# However, I soon realized how complicated it was to actually use Twitter API
# Paywalls and developer approval prevented me from using twitter (shame, it was a recent update).

# Thus, I looked into news articles.
# My curiosity led me to see if I can code a way to see the market sentiment from news articles.
# The way I wanted to do this was to use NewsAPI to get the overall market sentiment from 
# multiple news articles. I wanted to do this through article headlines. 
# So, I created def news_article_headlines().
