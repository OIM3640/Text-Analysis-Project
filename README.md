# Text-Analysis-Project
 
## 1. Project Overview

For data sources, I only used IMDB/Cinemagoer. I wanted to learn how to use text analysis with nltk to be able to process the reviews I extracted from Cinemagoer. I removed stop words, most punctuation, and was able to compute the frequency of words in each review. I wanted to create a script that would take 5 random terrible movies and figure out the frequency of words that aren't stop words, which I did successfully in my eyes. My learning goals were to struggle. Seriously, i wanted to have a ton of errors so that I would have to figure them out... and I did, and it was stressful. I got to experiment with Cinemagoer, string, collections, random, and nltk, but most important, I learned how to read documentation and ask ChatGPT for help when it comes to finding things in the documentation that I want to use for my code.

## 2. Implementation
This script extracts 5 random movies from the list of 100 bottom movies from IMDB, gets the reviews for them, strips the reviews of stopwords and most punctuations, then returns a dictionary with the 5 movie titles as keys and frequency of words in each review as values. I designed this script in a tower-like format, starting at the top of the tower and finishing at the bottom. There are 5 'floors' or functions to this tower, each floor cascading into one another. The top floor chose 5 random integers, the 4th floor used those integers to pick random movies from the bottom 100 movies from imdb, 3rd floor extracts reviews from those movies, 2nd floor strips most punctuation and stopwords from those reviews, and the 1st floor takes those filtered reviews and returns the word frequency for each movie's reviews. One major decision I had to make design-wise was actually that tower-format. There are many functions I could have combined, however, I wanted to improve readability and make it easier to debug (because I knew I would have some..) In my opinion, I am really proud of my design decision and it really helped me when debugging. NLTK's word tokenizer was really helpful in splitting the words up into a list for me, which was very synergistic with its stop words doc which I could use to remove stop words from that list. The counter from collections also synergized well with the filtered reviews that I had, easily being able to count the frequency of each word without me having to write a lot of loops to do that. The major algorithm I use is on the top floor, which was just a randomizer for numbers between 0 and 99, but every function used this randomizer in order to find the original 5 movies to use and because of this, it was integral to my script. A few things I learned along the way will be expressed in the screenshots. You'll see I encountered problems with importing the library at first as well as debugging. ChatGPT was an essential part of this learning process.
