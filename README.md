# Text-Analysis-Project
1. I used the data source of IMDB Movie Reviews and in order to analyze them I used Natural Language Processing and plotting using matplotlib. I was hoping to be able to predict the rating of a movie based off of the reviews left on IMDB.
2. I took each review, broke it up into sentences so that the Natural Language Processing (NLP) could understant it and calculated a polarity score for each sentence. These were compiled into averages for each review which were then formed into a chart depicting each review and to what degree the viewer enjoyed the film. Then I used the averages for each review and, using a weighting formula, calculated the predicted star rating of the film. I thought about using word frequencies and then using the NLP on that the gauge the rating of the film, but decided against it because I thought some words would be taken out of context and lead to inaccuracies.
I was really pleased with how little I needed to use ChatGPT as I got by with my understanding of dictionaries and lists which are compilled and re-compilled throughout the funcitons. ![Info on Continue](image.png) ![Embedded Dict 1](image-1.png)![Embedded Dict 2](image-2.png)
3. Here are the outputs of the reviews for 3 different movies on a scale of polarity: ![La La Land](image-3.png)![Whiplash](image-4.png)![Foodfight!](image-5.png) The predicted scores were 7.7, 7.8, and 7.6 respectively. The first two are not far off, but I specifically chose Foodfight! as it has a 1.3 star rating. This rating was thrown off because of the amount of reviews that were ironically praising the movie as a "masterpeice", so this form of calculation of a movie's rating is only dependent on what the top 25 most upvoted reviews say.
4. What went well was my use of print() in order to continuously keep an eye on everything that is going on with the code. I am very happy with how the function processes the data, however I wish there was a way to access every review from IMDB, not just the first page as adding more data will make it more accurate. I am also not 100% sure about my weighting process of the polarity scores (my last function), but I'm fairly certain that the more extreme the review, the more weight it holds over the final, predicted movie rating. I think I could improve the rating accuracy by also weighting the individual sentences of the reviews. I tried to implement it, but, with all the data, it became extremely difficult to read the printed code to ensure that what I was doing was working properly so I left it alone. I became much better about implementing print() funcitons while writing the code so that when it innevitably didn't work on the first try, I had ample information on what went wrong and how to fix it quickly. ChatGPT helped in a few areas, specifically I was stuck trying to use "pass" in order to not count the neutral values from the NLP. I asked ChatGPT a few quesitons about "pass" and why it wasn't working until it offered the solution, "continue". It also helped me get unstuck when trying to iterate out of an embedded dictionary, which I think I had the tools to figure out, I just didn't have a good enough understanding conceptually about dictionaries which was definately strengthened during the coding process of the project.
