Project overview:
The data sources I used for this project were the Wikipedia and IMDB movie reviews. The techniques that I used throughout the project were - characterizing by word frequencies, removing stop words, natural language processing, text similarity and text generation. I hoped to learn something new or learn about a new way to utilize python to feel like I was writing code that is useful and functional. It was a good opportunity to see and use code not used in class so far.

Implementation:
I decided to implement the methods of analyzing by starting with removing stop-words, and attempted to build up from there to get frequencies of those words and sort them in a better format. I also experimented with natural language processing, and text similarity with the wikipedia source. The methods I chose for the first source were less related to the source itself and more for experimentation and me trying to build one function on top of another. The IMDB source did serve a purpose related to the text generation. I asked chatgpt for some help in finding a new idea to test, and that was one that it provided me with. I used it to generate more text based on a IMDB review, and tried to make it so it would be content similar to the review sample. One design decision I had to make was when the text generation was not working properly for a while, and I was considering moving onto a new idea due to the timeline of the project. I wanted to continue working with chatgpt because I trusted that it would get it right immediately. Another design decision I had to make was where I did the functions for stop words and frequencies. I wasn't so sure that I was writing out the code correctly due to it being a bit different from what we've worked on, but I continued trying to do it that way instead of another for the purpose of trying to figure it out on my own. 

ChatGPT was helpful in trying to help me fix my code. It would sometimes take many times in order for it to get something right, but I was very patient and willing to work with the AI. ChatGPT first helped me out a bit when I was working through the word_frequencies function. I actually asked it first if it knew an easier way of removing stop words, and it recommended using nltk stopwords, as they already had a list of them stored in a number of languages. I kept coming up with errors everytime I tried to reformat the code in order to execute it, and unfortunately so did ChatGPT. It kept pushing the same or very similar solutions that would leave me with a number of string and boolean issues as it tried to help me. I had to work on how I worded things, or almost reprimand ChatGPT when it didn't do what I was hoping for. I also wanted my function to be complementary to the one I made to remove stop words, but that didn't necessarily work right away. I also got help from chatgpt in sorting the frequencies. My main work with the AI was for the text generation, in which I relied heavily on it to troubleshoot for me. It made a lot of mistakes and misleading me to the point where I almost gave up and felt like I was being mean to the AI. I trusted that it would work out, and eventually got it to work for me. It also helped me find out a way to try and make the generated text more relevant to the actual review, rather than spew out random things. I had to install a number of things like torch and attention mask to do this. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I definitely learned about a few new libraries but would say I need a break before working with ChatGPT again!


Results:
I accomplished learning about a few new libraries and their capabilities in helping me write out code, remove words from text, generate words and how to focus them. I honestly didn't find anything too exciting in terms of the methods of analyzation that I explored for the first section. I will say that it was nice to learn that NLTK already made it convenient to remove stop words, and it provoked me to see what other things nltk can do (https://www.nltk.org/). What I found in this section was more a confirmation of things I was expecting when running the code. 

What was most interesting was the discoveries I made in doing text generation. It took me a long time of working with ChatGPT to get things to a point where I was satisfied with the work I did. After downloading a few libraries and troubleshooting the code many times, I was just happy to get more relevant text generation in the end (sometimes!). I also tried playing around with the length of generation. While the extended reviews lost sight of the movie Up, I was happy to get them related to movies at least! I have attached some examples in the google doc! 

Reflection:
From a process point of view, what went well were the concepts that did not require as much help from ChatGPT, as there weren't really many crazy mistakes to make there. I could certainly improve how I chose to work on this project, as I would often get frustrated and wouldn't be satisfied until I saw the whole thing through. I would say my project was somewhat appropriately scoped. My testing plan was okay, as I chose to use both ChatGPT and the execution of the code multiple times and various ways of formatting. 

From a learning perspective, I would say that I have learned that I need to work on my patience a bit in learning the language, as we discussed in class the other day (this project made that very apparent to me), and to accept that I will make a lot of mistakes along the way. ChatGPT helped me troubleshoot and look at my code in new ways, but wasn't always the easiest to work with. I will definitely make sure to continue consulting other resources in addition to using this tool.
