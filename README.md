# Text-Analysis-Project

Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

1. Project Overview (~1 paragraph)

What data source(s) did you use? What technique(s) did you use to process or analyze them? What did you hope to create or learn through this project?

- The data source that I used was the Gutenberg data source. I found this data source to be the one that I was most comfortable with using. With this data source I came up with several ideas that I could explore for the project. I intended to make the project as unique and entertaining as possible, and the Gutenberg data source allowed me to do so. After analyzing the book repository and its content, I decided to narrow my work down to analyzing Emily Dickinson's poem books. To process and analyze I decided to use sentiment analysis techniques and frequencies of words in the text. For sentiment analysis I explored NLTK features, and for word frequencies, I used TF-IDF features which were provided through a link in the second part of the assignment's explenation. NLTK explenations in part two of the assignment's instructions and code examples were helpfull for this part. Given that I decided to work with poems, I thought this could be interesting as tone and feeling are one of the biggest components of poetry. My intention was to learn how to interact with GenAi in order to understand code further.


2. Implementation (~1-2 paragraphs)

Describe your implementation at a system architecture level. You should NOT walk through your code line by line, or explain every function (we can get that from your docstrings). Instead, talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice. Use shared links and/or screenshots to describe how you used GenAI tools to help you or learn new things.

- I decided to split up the code into three mains sections. The first section deals with obtaining and saving the data sets used. In order to download the text I used the code that was provided in Assignment two's guidelines under the "Data Source: Project Gutenberg" section. This code allowed me to insert a link and download the text within it. The saveTEXT function that follows saves the data to local files, by using standard python functions which I found in my Python 3 Cheat Sheet we were provided. The second section of the project deals with analyzing the data from the previous section. For this, I saved the poem's texts into lists, where each element of the list is a poem. The last section shows the results which are three different types of output. The first output is illustrated in a graph, which measures the poem's sentiment. I decided to use graphs to illustratate the output of the NLTK's sentiment analysis.  The second output is expressed in text, the standard output that the TF-IDF feature gives as well as some frequency metrics. I decided to go with these graph outputs because it was going to allow me to further understand the meaning of the data. To do this; the sentiment analysis section shows graph illustrations which I figured out with the code provided in the insutrctions under the sections of "Text Clustering." This section helped me understand the code, however I was still having some trouble to I resorted to using a website called W3Schools.com, and it helped understand the code further. Here is the link to that, (https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_plotting.asp). For further questions that I asked GenAi, please find the screenshots of my interactions in the project explorer. 

3. Results (~1-3 paragraphs + figures/examples)

Present what you accomplished in your project:

If you did some text analysis, what interesting things did you find? Graphs or other visualizations may be very useful here for showing your results.
If you created a program that does something interesting (e.g. a Markov text synthesizer), be sure to provide a few interesting examples of the program's output.

- I think that the most interesting things that I came across in this project was seeing and interpreting the sentiment analysis graph. As mentioned before, tone and emotion are one of the most important aspects of poetry, and when doing the project I was very interested in these measure, given that I have always big a big fan of peoms. This measure, which you can find attached in the gaph within the project explorer, helped me to understand the tone and emotion which composed the poems I analyzed. PS: I was unable to load tht graph image here directly, it is saved in the project's explorer as a .png file. When it came to analyzing and understanding these graphs, the most interest part was to see the trends within them, signifying the differences in sentiments between poems. On the other hand, if I would have not displayed graph, getting the same understanding with raw data and no illustration, would have been much harder. 
- Even though I got some help from GenAi to incorporate TF-IDF, and understand the framework, I found its output to be less usefull and harder to analyze the data. When compared to the output given for the graphs, the TF-IDF output was much more complicated and difficult to the eye.

4. Reflection (~1-2 paragraphs)

From a process point of view, what went well? What was the biggest challenge? How did you solve it? What could you improve? Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good testing plan?

From a learning perspective, what was your biggest takeaway from this project? How did GenAI tools help yo? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew beforehand that would have helped you succeed?

- From a process point of view, in terms of what went well, I was able to get the program to run properly after lots of revision and time working on it. The biggest challenge was getting all the aspects and different features in the project to work well together. With the help of GenAi and some documentation of class code in the assignments instructions, I was able to unfold this, and tie everything together properly. Overall, I believe that I scoped the project properly, however if I were to change something in the future, I could explore the idea of focusing on a single authors book, instead of comparing several different poem books like I did. 
- From a learing perspective, my biggest takeaway from this project wsa definelty patience. Trial and error and not giving up was crutial and lots of patience came with it. I found myself stuck at times during the project and would take some breaks to gather my thoughts and look back it with a fresh set of eyes. While doing this, I found some of the errors that I had made and was able to solve them. GenAI toold were helpfull when I needed some further ecxplenation or examples for certain frameworks and techniques used. The pictures to my questions and asnwers from GenAI are all attatched in the projects explorer. What I learned is going to be of great use because not only did I look further into these techniques, I applied them in the project and believe that helped understand the topics better. I wish I could have known a bit more of the topics likes the NLTK and the TF-IDF frameworks, thay way I wouldnt have taken as long into understading their uses and how they are applied. As a side note, I am extremely thankful of the projext extension which we were granted, it was definelty the timeframe needed to complete the work properly and to the best omy ability.
