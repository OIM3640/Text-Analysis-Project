## Reflection
In terms of what went well I liked working with the modular structure, when I split the code into seperate files it made it easier to debug the code and modify individual functions. The word frequency analysis showed interesting insights on on how characters were focused along with its victorian language. My biggest challange was during the text similarity comparison analysis because it first took over 5 minutes to run because I had originally been comparing sections of 5,000 words.I then decided to reduce the section size to 500 words to make it more practical so it would run quicker and you wouldn't have to wait there waiting. I learned how to use regular expressions for cleaning text as well as how to install and use external libraries like TheFuzz. In terms of AI for this project I used Claude AI which helped me troubleshoot import errors , optimize the slow code issue I had at first , and understand how to split up my project onto different modules that make sense. Claude suggested reducing the section size and simplyfying the similarity calculations. I now feel better about working with text data and installing and using external libraries in python. I now know to start with smaller text sections for analysis instead of running large analysis on the text files because if I don't it takes a long time for the code to work so I had to trade off analysis for functionality of the code.
