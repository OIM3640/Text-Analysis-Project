        "full_text":"Our social media platforms and government have had four years to get this right. Instead, they\u2019ve thrown up their hands.\n\nIn the days following January 6, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch suspended former president Donald Trump over posts the companies said glorified the violence at the Capitol. It was the most extreme moderation decision these companies had ever made. Platforms also took sweeping actions to remove thousands of accounts belonging to militias, conspiracy theorists, and the content they shared that led the US to that moment.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t last long.\n\nThis is an edition of the WIRED Politics Lab newsletter. Sign up now to get it in your inbox every week.\n\nIt's not your average politics newsletter. Makena Kelly and the WIRED Politics team help you make sense of how the internet is shaping our political reality.\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Read previous newsletters here.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Listen to the WIRED Politics Lab podcast.\n\nAfter the 2022 midterms, the balance of power shifted in Congress. Republicans now had a majority\u2014albeit a slim one\u2014in the House of Representatives and used that sliver of power to go after the researchers and trust and safety workers who did the dizzying work of debunking election myths. Jim Jordan was elevated to chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee and immediately launched investigations stifling the work of academics at best and launching harassment campaigns against entire moderation teams at worst. As a result of these attacks, the Stanford Internet Observatory, one of the top disinformation research groups, shut down for good over the summer.\n\nNow, much of the social media infrastructure built to protect our democratic systems in the months and days after the deadly riot has collapsed\u2014either by inattention or force. There are only five days left until Election Day and a chasm has formed in what little foundation remains.\n\nTo start with what we all know: Elon Musk took over Twitter and turned it into X, a conspiratorial wasteland where professional disinformation purveyors earn thousands of dollars peddling lies. Musk reinstated accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Andrew Tate, both of which were banned years before the 2020 election cycle even began. And, to bring us to the present day, Musk has spent the last few weeks campaigning for Trump and spreading election lies.\n\nThese fissures in platforms have happened across the board. Last year, Alphabet, Meta, and X reduced the size of their trust and safety teams and Meta completely abandoned a project building a new fact-checking tool as a result of cuts. Not only has Meta cast a blind eye to the militias currently organizing on its platforms, it is auto-generating militia-related groups.",

        "full_text":"For months, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk has used his platform to share election conspiracy theories that could undermine faith in the outcome of the 2024 election. Last week, the political action committee (PAC) Musk backs took it a step further, launching a group on X called the Election Integrity Community. The group has nearly 50,000 members and says that it is meant to be a place where users can \u201cshare potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.\u201d\n\nIn practice, it is a cesspool of election conspiracy theories, alleging everything from unauthorized immigrants voting to misspelled candidate names on ballots. \u201cIt's just an election denier jamboree,\u201d says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, who authored a recent report on how social media facilitates political violence.\n\nSince endorsing former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump following the first assassination attempt against him in July, Musk has become one of Trump\u2019s most important financial backers, pouring more than $100 million into the America PAC since July. The PAC has also been a pillar of the Trump campaign\u2019s ground game in swing states. WIRED reporting found that Blitz Canvassing, a contractor for the PAC, was threatening canvassers in Michigan, and transporting them in U-Hauls.\n\nEarlier in October, Musk appeared at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he repeated false claims that Democrats would allow undocumented immigrants to vote illegally, and encouraged Trump\u2019s supporters to vote.\n\nIn January 2021, the company then known as Twitter banned Trump\u2019s account for incitement to violence during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But since taking over and rebranding it as X, Musk has fired many of the people on the teams that worked to keep mis- and disinformation off the platform. Last year, X fired much of what remained of its elections integrity team. After the news broke, Musk posted on X, saying, \u201cOh you mean the \u2018Election Integrity\u2019 Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nBarrett says that the America PAC\u2019s Election Integrity Community group augments the work of other election-denying groups, like former Trump adviser Cleta Mitchell\u2019s Election Integrity Network. \u201cThis is a parallel anti-election, anti-democracy campaign designed to sow confusion and lay the groundwork for baseless objections to elections after Election Day. This is going on all across the country, and it's extremely dangerous,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cAnd we're going to see the results of it almost immediately when the polls close on November 5th.\u201d",

        "full_text":"Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC and several other defendants, including the reelection campaign for Representative Michelle Steel, a Republican from California, are accused of violating California labor law in a class action lawsuit filed in Orange County on October 30, according to court documents obtained by WIRED.\n\nThe named plaintiffs, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, were canvassers for Steel in October of this year, according to the suit, which alleges that they weren\u2019t paid agreed-upon wages. America PAC is named because it provided campaigning services for Steel.\n\nThe plaintiffs are also suing over an alleged failure to reimburse business expenses and for allegedly being provided inaccurate wage statements. The suit seeks class certification for \u201cAll current and former non-exempt employees of Defendants in the State of California who were employed as canvassers and canvassed for Michelle Steel at any time from October 30, 2023, through the present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Steel campaign has no knowledge of these individuals, they did not and do not work for the Steel campaign, and the campaign will not comment on individuals that involve a Super PAC with which we have no involvement,\u201d a spokesperson for the Steel campaign said in a statement.\n\nThese allegations are different from those WIRED reported earlier this week, when canvassers in Michigan said they were tricked and threatened as part of Elon Musk and America PAC\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump. The door knockers, who worked for a subcontractor of America PAC, were flown to Michigan, driven in the back of a U-Haul, and told they would have to pay hotel bills unless they met unrealistic quotas. One was surprised to find, upon arrival in Michigan, that they were working to elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe Blair Group, a North Carolina firm that the complaint claims is a political consultancy, and Liberty Staffing Services, a Florida firm specializing in hiring and payroll for canvassers and other W2 employees of political campaigns, are the other named defendants. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The suit also lists unknown Johns Doe as defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs are owed money, according to the suit.\n\n\u201cAs with other members of the Class, Plaintiffs were guaranteed an agreed upon wage hourly wage [sic] upon starting their employment. However, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendants failed to pay them at the correct hourly wage, and, instead, paid them based on the number of residences they canvassed. To date, Plaintiffs have yet to receive the underpaid wages owed to them,\u201d the complaint states.",

        "full_text":"It would be one thing if this were just a history lesson. But the same kind of dynamic is playing out right now in a few crucial arenas that virtually no one beyond California is talking about. And I\u2019m happy to report that the America taking shape on its Pacific coast is again inventing solutions far more rapidly than conventional wisdom has accounted for.\n\nI was bullish on these emerging transformations even before Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president. If she wins, what she knows from California will presumably affect her approach to the country and the world. Her California-ness is one of the least-discussed but most important aspects of her, including the upbeat approach to today\u2019s diversity and tomorrow\u2019s opportunities that is such a contrast to Donald Trump.\n\nBut if she doesn\u2019t get that far, California is likely to chug along with all the more purpose, maintaining its nation-scale example of how else things can be done. Whoever guides national politics, California deserves new attention as the \u201creinvention state\u201d rather than a \u201cresistance state.\u201d Even under Trump, there\u2019s still a good chance that as California goes, so eventually goes the country, and eventually much of the world. Here are a few illustrations of where it\u2019s headed. None of these is \u201cthe\u201d solution to California\u2019s many problems. But each of them illustrates the creative spirit from which solutions have always come.\n\nTrain to Somewhere\n\nFor starters, let\u2019s return to the thread of transportation: By now, of course, the pioneering freeway system California built in the 20th century is a maxed-out, congested mess. And the state cannot build more freeways; where they\u2019re needed, there\u2019s no more room, and any that are built fill up as soon as they\u2019re opened. Without new forms of transportation, the state will become increasingly paralyzed, and all its other problems will become worse. Which is why, back in 2008, California voters approved a nearly $10 billion initial bond issue to build a high-speed rail line eventually running some 500 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco, through the Central Valley corridor. That was 16 years ago. If you\u2019ve heard anything at all about this project since then, it\u2019s that it is a white elephant, a doomed relic, a cautionary lesson, and any other metaphor for failure you might choose.\n\nAnd yes, the complaint list is long. The project is way over budget (to the tune of $100 billion) and far behind its original schedule. Parts of the line were supposed to be up and running already. As it is, the first service isn\u2019t projected to begin until 2030\u2014and then only on the 171-mile segment from Merced, in the northern half of California\u2019s Central Valley, to Bakersfield, on the southern end. This abbreviated initial route has been dubbed a \u201ctrain to nowhere,\u201d a stock insult that grates on people in the Central Valley but captures the frustration of people stuck in LA or Bay Area traffic. And given how the entire funding-hungry project has become an object of the culture wars, it is little wonder that for many, the project seems as remote and implausible as human settlements on Mars.\n\nWhen done, this will be among the very fastest mainline high-speed rail systems running anywhere on Earth\u2014at 220 mph.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been following the back-and-forth for more than a decade, and I\u2019ve started to see California\u2019s high-speed rail project with a new clarity. In the aviation world, pilots are trained to recognize the \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d when you\u2019ve gone so far that you\u2019d only lose by going back. That\u2019s where California is with high-speed rail. Consider the weight of a few recent facts: This summer the project received full \u201cenvironmental clearance\u201d for the entire 463 miles from downtown LA to downtown San Francisco, with clearance for a further 31 miles from LA to Anaheim expected next year. Nearly all of the thousands of necessary land parcels have been secured. Construction in the Central Valley is much further along than most people realize: Some 12,000 people have long been at work there, and test trains should be running in three or four years. And what hasn\u2019t sunk in is that, when done, this will be among the very fastest mainline high-speed rail systems running anywhere on Earth. (At 220 mph, it would beat the 200-mph range for European trains and the famed Shinkansen in Japan, or match the fastest stretches of the Beijing-to-Shanghai line in China.) Not only that, in a worldwide first, California\u2019s system will use solar-generated electricity the entire way.\n\nOver the past decade, I\u2019ve visited Fresno, the biggest city along the initial route (population 545,000), about a dozen times. There and in surrounding areas you can see the rail taking shape month by month, mile by mile. You see the kind of gigantic, heavy-industrial construction projects I remember from living in China, when a new subway line seemed to be opening every month. You see earth movers bigger than school buses; concrete bridge-supports as long as airliners.",

        "full_text":"We are in the final days of a momentous presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Do you know whether your elected officials will accept the outcome?\n\nWIRED reached out to every single senator and member of the US Congress asking whether they would accept the results of the election as called by the Associated Press. Why the AP? Because in the absence of a national election authority, calls made by the AP\u2014a nonprofit cooperative\u2014have long been accepted as authoritative. We wanted something politically neutral, particularly because some local and state-level officials have indicated that they may not certify the results.\n\nYou can look up your zip code or state in the search bar below to find your congressional representative and senator, as well as their response to our question about whether they will accept the AP\u2019s results. In some instances, your zip code may not match your current congressional district, as district boundaries can change over time.\n\nWe organized the legislators\u2019 responses into three categories: those who will accept the results of the elections as reported by the AP, those who won\u2019t, and those who have not responded. This is a living document, and we will continue to update it with responses from representatives as we continue to receive them. When possible, we are also including the full responses from lawmakers to add further context to their responses. For instance, some lawmakers may say that they will accept the results when states certify but not based on the AP call.\n\nA note is attached to the results of all lawmakers who signed the \"Unity Commitment\" in September, vowing to certify the results after \"all legal means\" to challenge the outcome \"have been exhausted.\" Additionally, the results indicate if a lawmaker previously declared a commitment \"to certifying the election results\" as part of a USA Today poll conducted in mid-October.\n\nIt\u2019s the first presidential election since the January 6, 2021, insurrection, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and baselessly claimed the election had been stolen.\n\nIn the interceding years, election denial has gone from being the purview of fringe conspiracists to a staple of major figures on the American right. Trump has already indicated plans to challenge election results this year, and hundreds of Republican candidates for office have cast doubt on them as well. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has said that he would not have certified the 2020 election unless states had sent alternative pro-Trump electors.\n\nElection officials across the country have delayed or refused the certification of state and local election results. Conspiracy theories about the results of the 2024 election have already flooded the internet, as election denial groups, the Trump campaign, and people such as billionaire and X owner Elon Musk have spread falsehoods about election fraud.\n\nIn the face of the proven willingness of Trump and his allies to attempt to seize power after losing an election, a statement from elected officials that they will accept the results of the election as declared by a neutral arbiter is critical information for voters preparing to cast their ballots.\n\nDell Cameron, Vittoria Elliott, Leah Feiger, David Gilbert, Makena Kelly, and Dhruv Mehrotra contributed to this project.",

Yes, SNP sources say the increase in day-to-day spending is broadly in line with their expectations.\n\nThey mean it is broadly in line with what they have come to expect in recent months because there has been fairly good communication between the UK Treasury and the finance department in the Scottish government. Think back a little further to the general election campaign and one of the SNP\u2019s key attack lines was that a Labour government would deliver continued austerity. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, was pushed into a \"read my lips\" moment to deny that this would be the case. It turns out the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been able to deliver in her first budget. With \u00a31.5bn in extra spending for the Scottish government this year and an extra \u00a33.4bn in the year leading up to the Holyrood election, the SNP could hardly attack the budget as continuing austerity. Instead, Scottish Finance Secretary Shona Robison has found herself welcoming it as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d and trying to claim a degree of credit for Labour borrowing and spending more.\n\nPA Media Shona Robison is pushing the UK government to scrap the two-child cap on benefits\n\nShe is also arguing for sustained increases in devolved public spending over the coming years which may form a basis of the SNP\u2019s Holyrood election argument, depending on what the chancellor announces in future financial statements. The SNP will also continue to argue for more generous welfare spending, including an end to the two-child cap on benefits. That\u2019s a call with which many Labour politicians have sympathy. The UK government\u2019s response is \"ok, what tax would you raise or spending would you cut to pay for it?\" Overall, Labour has blunted SNP criticism of their budget plans and opened up some political space to shift the focus on to the delivery of better outcomes in schools, hospitals and other devolved public services which the SNP has been running for the last 17 years. Undeniably, there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nTreasury guddle\n\nWhere Labour has spoiled their own post-budget party in Scotland is by getting into a guddle over the detail of the chancellor\u2019s statement. When Rachel Reeves was asked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland if her \u00a33.4bn package for Holyrood would be topped up to offset the impact of increased employers\u2019 national insurance contributions on devolved public services, she suggested that had already been taken into account. In short, the answer appeared to be \u201cno\u201d. However, her cabinet colleague - Scottish Secretary Ian Murray - and the Scottish government had already said they thought there would be further funding to deal with this. It seems they and not the chancellor were right, according to a clarification from the UK government.\n\nPA Media Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay is calling for tax cuts",

        "full_text":"Investigating Musk's far-fetched claim about Democrats importing voters\n\nBBC News\n\nSince endorsing Donald Trump for president in July, Elon Musk - the owner of X - has posted about the US election hundreds of times, attracting more than four billion views. BBC Verify, working with data firm Node XL, analysed all of his posts since then - over 8,000 - and searched for key words to track the election issues he has been posting about most to his 200 million followers. Immigration and voting emerge as key themes with Mr Musk engaging with misinformation online about \"illegal aliens\" voting in this election. He has also claimed repeatedly that Democrats have been \"importing\" immigrants who will vote for them in future elections. But voting and immigration experts we have spoken to have challenged this, pointing out that it is illegal for them to vote in federal elections and that even if some might qualify for citizenship eventually, the process would take many years.\n\nWhat has Musk said about illegal immigrants voting in this election?\n\nMr Musk has engaged with posts on X which suggest that illegal immigrants are already voting in this election. On 30 October, he responded to a claim that illegal voters were able to apply for mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. Mr Musk replied to the claim, which has been rejected by local election officials, saying: \"Is this real?\" It is against the law for non-citizens to vote in US federal elections - punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation. A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of non-citizens having voted in US federal elections are very small. Since July, Mr Musk has posted at least 22 times about voters being \"imported\" from abroad. The language in many of these posts is ambiguous as to whether he means this will impact this election or future ones. In seven posts, he has said they are going directly into swing states. On 20 October, in a post viewed 21 million times, he said: \u201cTriple digit increases of illegals in swing states over the past 4 years. Voter importation at an unprecedented scale!\u201d\n\nAllow Twitter content? Twitter\u2019s cookie policy privacy policy \u2018accept and continue\u2019. This article contains content provided by Twitter . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readandbefore accepting. To view this content choose Accept and continue\n\nAlong with the post, he shared a table that showed very large percentage increases in \"unauthorized migrants\" in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, since 2021. The table, which does not have a source, had been posted by \"America\" - a political action committee Mr Musk set up to support Trump. We could not find evidence for these figures but migration experts pointed us towards the latest Department of Homeland Security report which has estimates for each state between 2018 to 2022. These show that in several states - including Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina - the number of \"unauthorised immigrants\" has remained steady or dropped over this period. They do show large numbers living in these states under the Biden administration but also when Trump was president.\n\nWhat has Musk said about Democrats importing voters to win future elections?\n\nMr Musk has repeatedly suggested that illegal immigrants will gain citizenship and sway future elections for the Democrats. In a post on 25 October, which got almost 17 million views, he said: \u201cTheir stated plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem. America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.\u201d Voting and immigration experts described this as a far-fetched claim.\n\nGetty Images Elon Musk has appeared at rallies with Donald Trump\n\nDemocrats have expressed a desire for some undocumented migrants in the US to have \"an earned pathway\" to citizenship, but it is not their stated policy to grant them all this. \"Some undocumented migrants who arrive in the US could have a route to citizenship - but that would typically take a decade or longer, if they even have a path at all, which many of them will not,\" says Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute. In several posts, Mr Musk mentions a 1986 bill which granted amnesty to approximately three million undocumented immigrants in the US. This was passed by Congress and signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan. It forgave individuals who came into the US illegally but did not give them immediate citizenship. \u201cPerhaps Musk imagines that a president or administration can simply decree mass naturalisation of noncitizens without going through the prescribed individual legal processes, and that Congress and the courts would simply then accept this. That's not how it works\", Walter Olson, a voting rights expert from the conservative think tank, the Cato Institute told us.\n\nWhat other evidence does Musk cite?\n\nOn 25 October, Mr Musk posted on X: \u201cMassive numbers flown directly to swing states and put on the fast track to citizenship. Voter importation.\u201d The post, viewed almost 19 million times, included a chart entitled \u201cinadmissible aliens\u201d shared by Mario Nawfal.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

A Russian bomb had shattered her shop windows - a common occurrence in the city of Zaporizhzhia. There\u2019s a 10-metre (32ft) wide crater in the middle of the road. \u201cOf course we are worried about the outcome [of the election],\u201d she adds. \u201cWe want to defeat the enemy!\u201d For Ukraine to have a remote chance of doing that, it needs the help of the US.\n\nIt was here in 2023, on this south-eastern part of the front line, where Ukraine launched a counteroffensive it hoped would force out the Russian invaders. Instead, after little to no progress, Ukraine\u2019s ambitions have switched to survival. Missiles and glide bombs slam into towns and cities daily, and its soldiers weather constant Russian attacks. Election polls - is Harris or Trump winning?\n\nHow the election could change the world While Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has suggested military aid would continue if she emerged the victor, her powers could be constrained by a Republican-run Congress. And the pipeline of military support, which so far totals more than $50bn, is looking less likely to be sustained under a second term for Donald Trump. Whoever becomes the next US president will have a profound impact on Ukraine\u2019s borders and everyone who lives within them.\n\nBBC\/Sara Monetta Russian strikes like the one which shattered Inna's shop windows are a horrifying fact of life in Zaporizhzhia\n\nIf, for example, they forced Ukraine to give up land and freeze the front lines, then regions like Zaporizhzhia could become suddenly divided like North and South Korea after the ceasefire that halted fighting - but never officially ended the war there - in the 1950s. Trump has said he would \u201cwork out something\u201d to settle the war and suggested Ukraine may have to give up some land. A second US option would be to pull its support completely, which would mean over time that Russian forces could eventually engulf the entire region and even more of Ukraine beyond it. The third scenario of Ukraine completely liberating its occupied territories is looking less and less likely.\n\nIt\u2019s this lack of battlefield progress that has made the merits of supporting Ukrainian troops like Andriy increasingly up for debate across the Atlantic. He\u2019s in charge of his unit\u2019s fleet of US-made armoured vehicles on the front lines. When they\u2019re not used for moving soldiers, they sit under camouflage netting along tree lines. \u201cIf aid stops or slows, the burden will fall on the shoulders of the infantry,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight with what we have, but everyone knows Ukraine can\u2019t do it on its own.\u201d Russian drones hunt civilians, evidence suggests\n\nWATCH: Putin challenged over Ukraine war by BBC reporter Andriy and his fellow Ukrainians are nervously awaiting the US vote on 5 November. The uncertainty is stifling battlefield ambitions and frustrating political efforts to secure more help. Western allies often look to America\u2019s example when deciding how or whether to support Kyiv\u2019s war effort. \u201cWhen we hear how one candidate, who is less willing to help us, is leading in the polls, it\u2019s upsetting and frustrating,\u201d says Andriy. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nBBC\/Maarten Lernout Ukraine's soldiers know that the US election could drastically affect their fortunes on the battlefield\n\nAmidst the autumnal farmland, the soldiers are keen to demonstrate the American kit they use - drones, grenade launchers and mounted machine guns. All, they say, far superior to their Soviet-era alternatives. Whether it\u2019s through Ukraine\u2019s natural resources or business ventures, President Zelensky is also trying to pitch his country as an investment opportunity to his allies. Drone pilot Serhiy explains how they can give direct feedback to Western manufacturers. \u201cWe have an online chat with them, and we make suggestions,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cImprovements are already happening.\u201d As demonstrated with drone manufacturing, the war in Ukraine is forcing innovations domestically. It\u2019s also allowing Western companies to test their products in an active warzone.\n\nBBC\/Maarten Lernout The outgoing Biden administration has recently pledged another $800m in military aid to Ukraine, including weapons and vehicles\n\nBillions of dollars of Western aid has also driven reforms in some areas of government. Kyiv wants to show it\u2019s a horse worth backing. The question is whether these advances will be eclipsed by a conflict increasingly going Russia\u2019s way. With an army typically only being as strong as its society, we head to meet someone who experienced Russian brutality first-hand. Lyubov\u2019s daughter and grandchildren fled to the US at the start of the full-scale invasion. We last met in her front-line village of Komyshuvakha two years ago, after the invading troops had destroyed her home.\n\nBBC\/Maarten Lernout Lyubov thinks Ukraine should not stop fighting Russia until it has freed all its territory\n\nThis time, she seemed happier, despite living close to the fighting for so long. In the warm confines of her new flat, I ask her whether Ukraine should negotiate to end the war. \u201cWhat about those who gave their lives?\u201d she replies. \u201cI see the end of the war only when we reach the 1991 borders of our country, when Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk were ours.\u201d There is almost endless coverage of the US election on Ukrainian news programmes, with war projections based on the potential winner. Kamala Harris is undoubtedly seen as Ukraine\u2019s preferred candidate, and journalists are trying to combat Russian disinformation against her.\n\nGetty Images Zelensky and Trump met in New York in September\n\nBut across Ukraine\u2019s south and east, we find a growing number of people who want the war to end immediately, and see a Donald Trump presidency as the best chance of bringing respite. We spoke to many of these people around the embattled eastern town of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces are inching closer. There\u2019s a feeling here that Ukraine should have negotiated at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, to prevent the death and destruction they\u2019ve seen since. Both sides engaged in talks in those early months of 2022. But evidence of alleged Russian war crimes halted attempts at diplomacy, and strengthened Ukraine\u2019s resolve to fight on. \u201cDeath is not worth territory,\u201d as one woman put it. \u201cWe have to stop this war, and Trump is the person who knows how to do that.\u201d Eleven years of Russian aggression is enough for some. For the politicians in Ukraine\u2019s parliament, it is not an openly shared sentiment. While there is still cross-party support to keep fighting, President Zelensky\u2019s \u201cvictory plan\u201d has been criticised for not having a clearer timeline.\n\nGetty Images Halyna, who lived in a multi-storey building damaged by a Russian airstrike\n\nAs for Lyubov, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to voice her preference on who should win the White House: \u201cI would like a true friend of Ukraine to win, who will continue to support us. But who it is going to be, I cannot tell you.\u201d As much as I admire Lyubov\u2019s inner steel, she reflects an increasingly popular and uncomfortable contradiction: a desire for Russia\u2019s defeat, while also wanting the bloodshed to end as soon as possible. The pendulum between US interventionism and isolationism is closely watched and felt in Ukraine. Ever since it voted overwhelmingly to be an independent country in 1991 during the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has had to fight for its sovereignty. It\u2019s found itself on the edge of a geopolitical tectonic plate, trying to align itself with the West as Russia pulls it the other way. Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion means Ukraine needs the helping hand of America to stop it from being torn apart. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Sara Monetta and Hanna Tsyba",

        "full_text":"Badenoch is favourite, but will she clinch Tory leadership?\n\nBBC\n\nFamously, it is the hardest job in politics: leader of the opposition. And it is particularly hard if your party has just gone down to a historically bad thrashing at the hands of the electorate. Any glance at the history books might not lift the spirits of the winner either. When the Conservatives last took an almighty pasting at a general election, in 1997, it took them 13 years and four leaders to make it back to power. When Labour were turfed out in 2010, it took them 14 years and three leaders before they won again in July. Nonetheless, the contest to replace Rishi Sunak as Conservative leader has been a competitive one. And precedents are there to be broken \u2013 as recent British political history attests to. At just after 11:00 GMT on Saturday, at a swish spot up the road from Westminster, we will find out whether it will be Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick who will replace Rishi Sunak as the Conservative Party leader.\n\nAsk most folk in and around politics who is most likely to win, and most say Badenoch. But polling the Tory party membership is not straightforward and it is a party whose internal races often throw up surprises. Both camps accept that turnout will be down from last time around two years ago, when Liz Truss beat Sunak and 82.5% of party members decided to have a say. \u201cI doubt it\u2019ll hit 70%,\u201d said one campaign source. When you are no longer picking a prime minister, the stakes are not quite so high.\n\nPA Media\n\nHere is how the morning will play out. Both candidates will arrive under their own steam. Each has their own green room back stage and there is a third room into which they will both be summoned to be privately told, together, what the result is, just before 11:00. They will then attempt to put on a poker face and head out into the results room to take their seats on the front row, the rest of us still clueless about the result. There will be a few words from the party chairman Richard Fuller, and then the result will be read out by the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Bob Blackman. It is then speech time for the winner. The loser will stay in their seat. Don\u2019t go on too long and talk to the country, and not just the party, is the mission statement for the winner in front of the lectern. Friday was set aside by both of them to trying to find the words that will do the job. After the speech, I\u2019ll be throwing myself into the scrummage of senior party figures trying to grab as many interviews as I can. Then an official car will scoop up the winner and whizz them to Conservative campaign headquarters in Westminster. Bits of paper to sign, security briefings to be had and a shadow cabinet to assemble. And for the loser? Find a cab to take you home. It is a brutal old game is politics.\n\n'I don't expect to sleep well'\n\nExisting frontbenchers, who have served under Sunak, have been asked, I\u2019m told, to remain available in their current posts until Wednesday. While the winner is likely to put in place their most senior team members over the weekend and into the beginning of next week, filling all the junior ranks will take some time, and there will be parliamentary appointments to keep from first thing Monday morning. So who is going to win? The long standing expectation of most since Badenoch and Jenrick became the final two was that Badenoch was the favourite. Since the polls closed on Thursday that has remained the view of most, but not all. \u201cI still don\u2019t expect to sleep well,\u201d said one Badenoch supporter told me last night, adding waspishly: \u201che had a year\u2019s head start\u201d \u2013 a reference to Jenrick\u2019s resignation from government in December last year, widely seen by his colleagues as his first move in a leadership pitch. Badenoch remained a cabinet minister until the Conservatives\u2019 defeat in July. Jenrick has approached the contest as the underdog \u2013 and approached it with colossal energy too, doing 250 events and meeting around 20,000 party members. He also appears to have said yes to almost every media invite to appear on telly, radio, newspapers, podcasts or online on any given day of the week. Badenoch waited until the last few days for a media blitz, but was also hurtling around the country meeting as many party members as possible. \u201cShe has that sparkle, we\u2019d be in for one heck of a fight with Starmer with her,\u201d one of her supporters tells me. But both Badenoch and Jenrick know it would be one heck of a job they would be taking on. Not long to wait now to find out whose job it will be.",

        "full_text":"Tory leadership race: Seven things you might have missed\n\nGetty Images\n\nNearly four months after the Conservatives went down to their worst defeat in a general election in their history, they have chosen a new leader. Either Kemi Badenoch has been unveiled as the winner of the party's leadership contest. Here is a look back at highlights - and low moments - of the campaign.\n\nNon-runners\n\nGetty Images\n\nSeveral big figures in the party never made it to the starting line. The Tories were reduced to 121 MPs in the general election - losing more than 240 seats including those held by 12 cabinet ministers. Just like Michael Portillo in 1997, Penny Mordaunt, Grant Shapps and Gillian Keegan lost any hope of leading the party, this time at least, overnight as they were ejected from Parliament by the electorate. Among those who hung on, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - regarded for some time as the standard bearer of the right - decided not to run and endorsed former immigration minister Jenrick, her one-time junior at the Home Office, instead.\n\nMelmentum\n\nGetty Images\n\nMel Stride almost lost his Central Devon seat on 4 July - but clung on by 61 votes. Despite having the lowest profile of any of the six candidates in the leadership race, he had cultivated a reputation for having a safe-ish pair of hands during his many appearances in media interviews during the general election. It was a brand the former work and pensions secretary was keen to burnish, pitching himself as the unity candidate who could restore trust in the party. In the opening ballot of Tory MPs, he outpolled former Home Secretary Dame Priti Patel. But any sense of \"Melmentum\" then stalled and Stride was knocked out before the roadshow moved on from Westminster to Birmingham.\n\nMerch wars\n\nGetty Images\n\nHe would later be the next contender to be eliminated, but there can be no question that former soldier - he mentioned it once or twice - Tom Tugendhat won the \"merch wars\" at the party conference in Birmingham, hands down (and sometimes up). Fun merch is a staple of all parties' annual gatherings as activists meet to chew over the year's highs and lows. In Birmingham, Jenrick's \"We Want Bobby J\" baseball caps deserve an honourable mention. But Team Tugendhat led the field with souvenir hats, t-shirts, mints with his name on them, tattoos - and even Tugend-tan, fake tan.\n\nMaternity pay\n\nGetty Images\n\nNo stranger to controversy, and usually not someone to shy away from it, Badenoch was determined to shut down a row over an interview she gave at conference, in which she suggested maternity pay had \"gone too far\". She later told reporters she did not think maternity pay \"needs changing at all\", and insisted her comments had been \"misrepresented\" because she was talking about cutting regulations on business. But not before her leadership rivals had seized upon her initial remarks. Later, at a fringe meeting at conference, Badenoch quipped that some civil servants were so bad, they should be in prison. But this time there was no distancing herself from the remark. It was an off-the-cuff joke and she embraces being outspoken.\n\nSpecial forces claim\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere were few \"blue-on-blue\" clashes during the campaign. Bob Blackman, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee running it, warned candidates he would issue yellow cards to any candidate who publicly attacked a rival. But there was real fury when Jenrick claimed that British special forces were \u201ckilling rather than capturing terrorists\u201d, because of the constraints of human rights laws. Tugendhat, who along with James Cleverly has served in the military, said he was \"angry\" at a \"very serious accusation\" which showed \"a fundamental lack of awareness of military operations, the command chain, and the nature of the law in the armed forces\". \u201cOur military do not murder people,\" Cleverly agreed. Jenrick stood by his claim.\n\nCleverly's shock exit\n\nPA\n\nThey're all smiling, but only two of them are waving to their supporters. And those are the two that would be eliminated days later by their MP colleagues. It was James Cleverly's exit from the contest that was the most surprising. Most party members seemed to agree that he won the battle of the speeches that dominated the final day of the conference in Birmingham, telling the party faithful they needed to be \"more normal\" and offer Conservatism \"with a smile\". He then established a clear lead in Tory MPs' penultimate ballot - only to be dramatically eliminated 24 hours later when they voted again: Badenoch 42, Jenrick 41, Cleverly 37. There were gasps in the Commons committee room where the result was announced. So what happened? Tory MPs have sometimes been said by some on their own side to be the \"most duplicitous\" of electorates. Multiple theories were advanced. But it was a secret ballot, so the truth will never be known.\n\nThe debate that never was\n\nGetty Images",

        "full_text":"Mail-in voting is one of the major modern conveniences afforded to US voters, but with Election Day less than a week away, it might be too late in some states to request a mail ballot if you haven't already.\n\nMail-in ballots -- known sometimes as \"absentee ballots\" -- are an increasingly common method of voting, with the COVID-19 pandemic pushing way more people than ever before to consider the option. Voting by mail had been steadily increasing for years, but according to the Election Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it leapt from around 23 million in the 2018 midterms to 43 million during the 2020 presidential race and then dipped to about 32 million in 2022 midterms.\n\nSo with millions of US citizens already casting their ballots during early voting periods, read on for a breakdown of which states will still allow you to request a mail ballot. For more about voting, see if there's still time to register in your state and if early voting has started there as well.\n\nWhere is it too late to request a ballot?\n\nNot surprisingly, with a week left until Election Day -- Nov. 5 -- the deadline for requesting a mail ballot has passed in many states. The following list contains the states where, as of Thursday, Oct. 31, all deadlines for requesting mail ballots have passed, according to Vote.org:\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nIdaho\n\nIndiana\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaine\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNebraska\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Virginia\n\nOne important thing to note about Rhode Island: while Vote.org notes that its deadlines for requesting mail ballots passed three weeks prior to Election Day, the state does allow residents to request an \"emergency ballot.\" This can be done at a local election office, but only if they find that they will be unable to make it to the polls on Election Day.\n\nWhich states still let you request a ballot?\n\nWith less than a week to go until the general election, a surprisingly large number of states still have options available for requesting mail-in ballots, according to Vote.org. Be warned, though, with so few days left, the deadlines for these remaining options will be here very soon.\n\nConnecticut: Both mail and in-person requests can be made if received by the day before Election Day.\n\nDelaware: In-person requests must be made by 12 p.m. the day before Election Day.\n\nIllinois: In-person requests can be made until the day before Election Day.\n\nIowa: In-person requests can be made until the day before Election Day.\n\nMaryland: In-person requests can be made as late as Election Day itself.\n\nMichigan: In-person requests can be made by 4 p.m. the day before Election Day.\n\nMinnesota: In-person, mail and online requests can be made any time prior to Election Day.\n\nMississippi: There are no set deadlines for mail-in and in person requests, but the state strongly recommends no later than Oct. 29 for mail. Mail-in voting here, however, is limited to people with eligible excuses for not voting on Election Day.\n\nMissouri: Requests can be made in person until 5 p.m. the day before Election Day.\n\nMontana: In-person and mail requests can be made until noon the day before Election Day.\n\nNew Hampshire: This state has no specific deadline for in-person and mail requests, though only people with an eligible excuse can receive an absentee ballot.\n\nNew Jersey: In person requests can be made by 3 p.m. the day before Election Day.\n\nNew York: In-person requests can be made until the day before Election Day.\n\nNorth Dakota: This state has no specific deadline for in-person or mail requests, but the latter must be postmarked by the day before Election Day.\n\nSouth Dakota: In-person and mail requests can be made until the day before Election Day.\n\nWisconsin: In-person requests can be made until Nov. 3.\n\nWyoming: In-person and mail requests must be received by the day before Election Day.\n\nWhat about all-mail voting states?\n\nCertain states -- California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia, have transitioned their elections to an all-mail system. This means that all registered voters are sent ballots in the mail by a certain time, which they can choose to fill out and return or choose to ignore and vote in person. As such, deadlines for requesting ballots in these states are usually not necessary.\n\nIf at this stage in the election season you find that you haven't received a ballot, perhaps because of a change in address, it would be best to call your local elections office to see what options are available to you.\n\nFor more about mail voting, find out how to track your ballot once it's sent.",

        "full_text":"The seemingly never-ending 2024 presidential election is in its final sprint, with early voting underway in some states and less than a week to go before voting hits its zenith on Election Day.\n\nThe race remains too close to call and candidates are making the most of its last days, bouncing from one battleground state to another, trying to, if not change voters' minds, then at least make sure their supporters turn up at the polls.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, experts say, the American election system is stronger than it's ever been. Voting technology has been hardened over the past several election cycles, boosting security and making it easier to double-check results, if need be. Voting tech has also gotten a boost from a new, younger and tech-savvy workforce.\n\nRead more: How the Election Could Change the Way We Use the Internet\n\n\"In many ways we are increasingly confident about the run-up to the election \u2014 that we will have an election that is free and fair and secure and smooth,\" Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, said during an Oct. 16 press briefing.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped former President Donald Trump, his allies and others from spreading disinformation and outright lies about the voting process for their own political gain, effectively laying the groundwork for court challenges if they lose.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, in a post on the social media platform X, Trump made accusations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania's York and Lancaster counties, even though officials in those locations are still investigating what, if any, problems may have occurred with voter registration applications.\n\nVoting experts fully expect court challenges over mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, if Trump loses.\n\nThis is what they say they worry about most: that frivolous lawsuits will drag out the election certification process while also covering baseless conspiracy theories with a veneer of false legitimacy. Or worse: that a misunderstood, disputed outcome could lead to violence.\n\nAnd especially with a race this close, counting everyone's vote will take time. It's unlikely that we'll know who the winner is right away.\n\n\"We're increasingly nervous about the aftermath, about the consequences of the efforts to discredit the results and what will come after, potentially,\" said Waldman.\n\nThat's why it's so important for voters to know that voting technology and the processes around it are secure and well-run.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't respond to an email seeking comment for this story.\n\nSecure by design\n\nTrump has refused to say he'll accept the results of the election if he loses. This isn't new or unexpected. Trump and other election deniers continue to claim \u2014 falsely \u2014 that the 2020 election was rigged.\n\nNot only were the 2020 presidential results repeatedly backed by both voting experts and the courts, election security has continued to improve in the years since, said Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director for Verified Voting, which promotes the responsible use of technology in elections.\n\nLindeman pointed to the near elimination of paperless electronic voting machines. Voting experts had fretted about these devices for years, because they didn't include a paper printout of votes that election officials could use for an audit or recount.\n\nAnd though the idea of someone hacking an election to change an outcome was always farfetched, the concerns have boosted awareness among elections officials of the need for cybersecurity measures and practices. (Misinformation campaigns are a different matter.)\n\nThe generation of election workers that's come in to replace retiring baby boomers has helped with this, Lindeman said. They bring with them both a comfort with technology and an eagerness to learn about the election process.\n\nAlthough election security isn't necessarily perfect, Lindeman says the vast majority of the things that could go wrong with election technology are largely problems the system could recover from.\n\n\"We talk about resilience,\" he said. \"That's what resilience means. If something breaks, we fix it. That's a pretty good place to be.\"\n\nYour vote is your voice. Getty Images\/Viva Tung\/CNET\n\nThe monsters in the closet aren't real\n\nDespite what some people still think, the very nature of how elections are run, and the technology behind them, make elections incredibly hard to hack in the traditional sense.\n\nElections are run by individual states, not the federal government. Voting machines vary across the country, and each state does things a little differently. Most of these systems aren't connected to the internet. Paper copies ensure that votes can't be flipped. Results can't be changed by some shadowy figure on the other side of the world.\n\nBut some people are just never going to believe that. And it doesn't help that people in positions of authority continue to spread conspiracy theories focused on baseless claims of undocumented immigrants casting ballots and voting machines being compromised, and that they continue to push the falsehood that the 2020 election was fixed.\n\n\"When people have made up their minds to believe that something terrible happened, you're never going to argue them out of that,\" Lindeman said. \"It's like trying to argue with your kid about a monster in the closet.\"\n\nThe Russians figured that out, too. Reports of Kremlin-sponsored election meddling go back to at least the 2016 election. More recently, US officials in September seized a pair of websites tied to the Russian government and charged two Russian state media employees with spreading disinformation ahead of the November election.\n\nAnd US officials said last week that it was Russia that created and spread a fake video that purports to show someone destroying ballots marked for Trump in Pennsylvania. The bogus video was quickly debunked by local officials, yet it still circulated widely on social media.\n\nBut some of the most damaging disinformation, voting experts say, has been spread by Trump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk and House Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, both known for spreading voter fraud conspiracy theories on platforms like X. Musk, who's endorsed Trump and recently appeared alongside him at rallies, is the most-followed person on X. As the platform's owner, his posts often show up in the feeds of users who don't follow him.\n\nGreene, meanwhile, claimed in recent X posts that a voting machine in her district \"flipped\" a vote and she encouraged voters to check their paper printouts to make sure the same thing didn't happen to them. Lindeman said there's nothing nefarious behind such a mixup and that it's likely the voter possibly had shaky hands or otherwise just tapped the touchscreen button for a different candidate than they wanted. And local officials said the problem was taken care of before the voter left the precinct. Still, Greene's original post has so far been viewed more than 3.6 million times.\n\nRegardless of Greene's claim, the incident underlines Lindeman's point about how paperless electronic voting machines have largely been eliminated, allowing for printouts that not just election officials but also every voter can check to make sure they got things right. Such assurances, however, aren't enough to keep social media posts like Greene's from going viral and stoking voter fears of those imaginary monsters in the closet.\n\nThat's especially worrisome in a highly anxious political environment still scarred by the bloody Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters as Congress was gathered to certify the 2020 election results. In the Public Religion Research Institute's American Values Survey, released earlier this month in partnership with the Brookings Institution, 29% of Republicans said they believe that \"true American patriots may have to resort to violence to save the country,\" compared with 16% of independents and 8% of Democrats.\n\n\"We should just let this sink in a little bit,\" Robert Jones, PRRI's president and founder said at a Brookings Institution event announcing the survey results. \"This is actually quite alarming.\"\n\nMaking it harder to vote doesn't make elections more secure. Getty Images\/Viva Tung\/CNET\n\nNew laws could make voting harder\n\nVoting experts say that given the groundwork already laid, court challenges are almost a certainty if Trump loses. It's anyone's guess if there will be political violence akin to the Jan. 6 assault.\n\nBut those who've made it their mission to protect voting rights say damage has already been done. Laws that've been passed in the name of solving election security problems that just don't exist are instead keeping legitimate voters from casting their ballots.\n\nSince the last election, lawmakers in 32 states have passed a combined 133 laws that have either made it harder for voters to access the ballot, or made it harder for local elections officials to do their jobs, said Jay Young, senior director of voting and democracy for the social justice group Common Cause. The new hurdles those voters face include things like new proof of residency requirements, shortened deadlines for mail-in ballot applications, the elimination of drop boxes, and restrictive voter ID requirements, Young said.\n\nEzra Rosenberg, director of the Voting Rights Project for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said citizen access to voting is the real concern.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the threat to election integrity in this country is not the maybe one or two people who vote every year who should not be allowed to vote,\" Rosenberg said during a recent panel discussion held by the Brookings Institution. \"It's the threat that thousands of people who are eligible to vote are being denied the right to vote either intentionally or inadvertently.\"\n\nElection Day and beyond\n\nThe thought of political intimidation and violence, whether it be armed people camped out beside a ballot drop box, or something on the scale of the Jan. 6 insurrection, has a lot of people worried.\n\nSo does the thought of endless frivolous court challenges aimed at dragging out the election certification process and breeding distrust in the election system. Given the tightness of the race and the passage of laws in some key states, like Pennsylvania, that will make the vote-counting process slower, we probably won't know immediately who won the election.\n\nIt's possible the process could take days, especially if some results are audited or recounted. And that's OK, said Lindeman. It's all part of the American election process.\n\nThe problem is that although that time helps ensure accurate results, it also gives disinformation time to take hold and flourish. Lindeman said voters should be patient and give election workers the time they need to do their jobs right.\n\nAnd though it might not be quick and easy this time around, Lindeman said he's optimistic democracy will prevail. There will be a winner and reasonable agreement among most people as to who that winner is.\n\n\"I think we're all going to come out the other side of this,\" he said.",

Some countries treated this as a lesson to diversify reserves away from the greenback, prompting high demand for the bullion metal.\n\n\"We assume that central bank purchases will moderate to a monthly pace of 30 tons \u2014 about a third of the elevated 85 tons average monthly pace observed since 2022, but structurally higher than the 17 tons monthly average pace before the freezing of Russia's reserves\u2014by end-2025,\" analysts wrote.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nSecond, easing US interest rates will gradually boost Western ETF holdings backed by gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldman expects the Federal Reserve to reduce the fed funds rate to the 3.25%-to-3.5% range midway through 2025. Since the gold doesn't yield interest, easing monetary policy typically boosts gold's competitiveness. When rates are high, the commodity loses out against other interest-bearing assets.\n\nIn a September note, Goldman found that gold-backed ETFs rise gradually for a six month period as rate cuts occur. This boost matters to the price of gold since rising ETF holdings bear down on the physical supply of the metal.\n\nThird, safe haven investors will have more reason to keep piling into gold.\n\nGoldman said speculative positioning has risen to high levels over geopolitical and inflationary concerns. The bank anticipates that this could normalize as uncertainty softens gradually after the election, which could prompt some near-term downside risk to the price of gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, analysts wrote that gold will remain an attractive hedge in the long term amid a potential escalation of new tensions. These include trade disputes, threats to the Fed's independence, US debt fears, and the chance of a future recession.",

And nobody knew where they came from.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut officials in charge of tabulating those election results counter that no one asked at the time why those ballots arrived so late.\n\nDetroit Elections Department Chief Operating Officer Daniel Baxter says he could have supplied the answer. He supervised poll workers who had to wade through more than 170,000 absentee ballots \u2014 about two-thirds of all the votes cast in the city.\n\n\u201cYou gotta remember we were in the middle of the pandemic. Nobody wanted to go to the polls on Election Day, so they opted to vote by absentee,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cAnd some of them were a little slower than others in terms of getting them delivered. And that is exactly what you experienced at 3 o\u2019clock, 4 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\nBut as the vote-counting wore on, the situation deteriorated. Hundreds of people converged on the convention center. It escalated when the hall reached full capacity and certain challengers were ordered to leave.\n\n\u201cI heard banging on the windows,\u201d Baxter recalled. \u201cI heard chanting, \u2018Stop the count! Stop the count!\u2019 It was a hairy moment.\u201d\n\nBaxter said it was hard for those counting votes to keep from being distracted. And then things got worse.\n\n\u201cSomeone made the bad call of putting cardboard up on the windows. When I discovered that I made sure it was removed,\u201d he said. \u201cI got on the microphone and explained to our staff, all of our poll workers, that we were not going to stop counting until the last ballot was delivered here.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Elaine Cromie\/Getty Images\n\nWhat's changed for the 2024 election\n\nAfter the near riot, those who game-planned for the next presidential contest hardened their resolve to protect poll workers, says City Clerk Janice Winfrey, who oversees all of Detroit\u2019s elections.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWe got through 2020 when all of that happened, the threats and the hurling insults at election workers. And it wasn\u2019t expected. So now we know that may happen and we are ready if it should happen,\u201d Winfrey said.\n\nThat includes new security procedures designed to block any Election Day upheavals at what is now called Huntington Place.\n\nOfficials moved the central polling location to the enclosed, cavernous Hall A, on the opposite end of the center from where votes were tallied in 2020.\n\nBaxter says there won\u2019t be any banging on windows at Hall A.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no windows. And if you do not have credentials you cannot be inside in any area. Those folk who decide to be present for protests or whatever, the Detroit Police Department has designated an area where they can be.\u201d\n\nBaxter says the new location is also a smaller and more secure space than its 2020 counterpart.\n\nHe says it\u2019s usable because Michigan now allows Detroit to tabulate absentee ballots more than a week ahead of Election Day.\n\nThat means fewer workers are needed for each shift because the vote-counting is spread across numerous days.\n\n\u201cWe only have 50 tables for processing. In 2020 we had 134 tables. That made for more people, more challengers, more poll workers,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cNow at the table you have 300 ballots that you have to process, versus 3,000 ballots in 2020.\u201d\n\nThere are also magnetometers guarding the doorways. Media, poll workers and challengers must swipe a driver\u2019s card, state ID or some other form of identification to get credentials.\n\nAnd Baxter says officials will keep track of how many people get in.\n\n\u201cA digitized check-in system will contain a maximum number for each group and organization,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we max out on that number no one will be allowed entry, whether it\u2019s the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the NAACP, the League of Women Voters or whoever they are.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe need to harden infrastructure as well as resolve became glaringly apparent in 2022.\n\nWinfrey, the city clerk, notes there was an incident at a building roughly 4 miles away from Huntington Place, where a GOP challenger confronted a deputy clerk in an alley behind the Elections Department.\n\n\u201cAll of our windows on the first floor of our building has been replaced with bulletproof glass,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cWe have uniformed and plain-clothed officers. And the alleyway is now blocked off.\u201d\n\nWinfrey and Baxter estimate with early voting this year, workers will tabulate about 90% of Detroit\u2019s ballots by early evening on Election Day.\n\nThat means poll workers should be able to leave the convention center much earlier than in 2020, shielding them, officials hope, from any disruptions by angry poll challengers.",

While no votes can be cast after Election Day, many states allow postmarked mail ballots to come in for several days after, and for voters to fix errors with their ballots.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the next few weeks\n\nElection officials will always tell you that results reported on election night are unofficial.

One of those rules requires voters to place their ballot into a \u201csecrecy envelope\u201d before placing it into the mailing envelope. Without the secrecy envelope, the ballot is considered \u201cnaked\u201d and will not be counted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUnder a statewide notification system, voters get an email telling them that their naked ballot has been invalidated and that \u201cyou can go to your polling place on election day and cast a provisional ballot.\u201d Most counties follow that practice, but some, like Butler County, Pa., do not.\n\nAfter two voters in the 2024 primary election were notified that their ballots would not be counted because they had not put their ballots in the secrecy envelope, the voters went to the polls on Election Day to cast provisional ballots. But Butler County refused to count their votes.\n\nThe voters sued, arguing that the Board of Elections was obligated to count their provisional ballots. The Republican National Committee and the Butler County Board of Elections countered that under the state election code provisional ballots cast by those whose mail ballots were received on time cannot be counted, even if the mail ballots were deemed invalid.\n\nIn a 4-3 decision, Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court sided with the voters. The court determined that a naked ballot is automatically void, meaning it was never received or counted by the Board of Elections. Under that logic, if the ballot was never received, a voter is eligible to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican Party and the RNC appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to block the decision. They argued that the state supreme court's decision \u201cdramatically change[d] the rules governing mail voting\u201d and usurped the state legislature's role of regulating federal elections.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, leaving in place the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that allows provisional votes to be cast and counted when a \u201cnaked\u201d mail-in ballot is invalidated.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how many ballots the high court decision will affect or whether it will ultimately impact the outcome of the presidential election. The RNC estimates it could affect tens of thousands of voters. Other election experts say the number is likely far lower. Regardless of the number, Pennsylvania is sure to be a key state on Election Day and depending on how close the race is between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump, the decision could be critical in deciding the presidency.",

The Mexican regional band Los Tigres del Norte warmed up the crowd before Harris took the stage in Phoenix, and at one point in her address she led the audience in a chant of \"Si se puede,\" or \"Yes you can.\"\n\n\"He insults Latinos, scapegoats immigrants -- and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do,\" Harris said of her Republican opponent. \"If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies, only on a much greater scale than last time.\"\n\nArizona \u2014 which Trump lost by less than 11,000 votes in 2020 \u2014 remains one of the most closely contested states in this year\u2019s election. Republicans are hoping a ballot measure that would make illegal border crossings a state crime will help motivate support for Trump, while Democrats have sought to mobilize voters around a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state\u2019s constitution.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe race in Nevada\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter Arizona, Harris traveled to Nevada for rallies in Reno and Las Vegas.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Harris was introduced by the pop icon Jennifer Lopez, who spoke about a comedian\u2019s crude joke referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden in New York last weekend.\n\n\"At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,\" Lopez said. \"It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, okay \u2014 it was every Latino in this country.\"\n\nThe remark at Trump's rally initially brought a wave of backlash against the former president, but by Wednesday Harris was having to clean up comments made by President Biden during a video call in which he sounded like he was calling Trump supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201d Trump responded in Wisconsin on Wednesday by speaking to the press from inside a garbage truck.\n\nTrump continued to attack Harris for the remark in a campaign stop Thursday in Henderson, just outside of Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cHow stupid is a man to say that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHow stupid is a man to say that. But she believes it, too.\"\n\ntoggle caption Ian Maule\/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHis meandering address touched on a wide range of topics. Trump claimed Harris lacked the stamina to run for office, hyped his social media platform TruthSocial and bragged about his endorsement from Elon Musk.\n\n\"I would say, you got to say, in terms of computer, I would say he's probably about as good as you get,\" Trump said about Musk.\n\nAt one point, Trump also suggested that Border Patrol officers are able to determine which migrants are good and which are bad just by looking at them.\n\n\"They go trouble, trouble, trouble, \u2014 no trouble \u2014 trouble, trouble. They can look at them and they can see good or bad,\" Trump said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump was in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale later on Thursday speaking at an event with Tucker Carlson, the conservative commentator known for stirring controversy.\n\nWith their stops in Nevada, home to a large population of service industry workers, both candidates were returning to a state where they have touted plans to eliminate taxes on tips for hourly workers.\n\nIn Nevada, Latinos make up just over one in five eligible voters, while in Arizona they represent 25% of the eligible voter population, according to the Pew Research Center. Democrats have traditionally won significant shares of the demographic, but polling has shown the Republican nominee chipping away at that advantage.\n\n\n\nA rare stop in New Mexico\n\nTrump also made an unusual campaign stop in New Mexico on Thursday, a state that has not elected a Republican to the White House since 2004. The rally in Albuquerque marked his first time in the reliably Democratic state since his 2020 run for the White House.\n\nTrump told the crowd he traveled to the state to win over Latino voters.\n\n\"I\u2019m here for one simple reason: I like you very much, and it\u2019s good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community,\" he said.\n\nTrump said it would take record turnout from Latino voters for him to win New Mexico, and also claimed he's won the state every year he\u2019s run for president, despite back to back losses in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\n\nThe home stretch\n\nStarting Friday, the two campaigns will be racing from swing state to swing state trying to rally supporters and win over the last remaining undecided voters. Harris will have stops in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin before wrapping her campaign Monday with a flurry of rallies in Pennsylvania \u2014 including one in Allentown, where more than half of the people are Latino -- mainly Puerto Rican.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump will be traveling to Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. He also has a stop in Virginia \u2014 a state Harris is widely favored to win. His campaign has not yet announced where he will spend his final day of campaigning.",

Some of those unsubstantiated claims are poised to become grist for Republican lawsuits contesting results should former President Donald Trump lose.\n\nOne hub of these efforts is an \"Election Integrity Community\" on X, formerly Twitter, set up by owner Elon Musk's super PAC, that is inviting users to \"share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe feed is full of unverified claims and rumors. A video of a Republican poll watcher suggesting \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that ineligible noncitizens can vote as long as they can present a driver's license got over a million views. Other users were suspicious when they were told by election workers to put their ballots into drop boxes, which have been a subject of baseless conspiracy theories since 2020. A surge of posts claimed that voting machines were flipping votes in Georgia and elsewhere, which both the Georgia secretary of state and the manufacturer have debunked.\n\n\"What we're seeing\u2026is a kind of motivated misinterpretation where people [who are] skeptical already\u2026of whether elections are trustworthy \u2014 they've been told by some of their favorite candidates in some cases, that we can't trust the results\u2026if that candidate doesn't win,\" said Kate Starbird, professor at University of Washington and co-founder of its Center for an Informed Public, which is tracking election rumors.\n\n\n\nViral false claims could fuel lawsuits\n\nWhile people also gathered alleged evidence of fraud during the 2020 election, those who may challenge the election results are more ready to leverage the material this time around, Starbird said.\n\n\"There are lawyers at the ready to go take these rumors, misperceptions, misinterpretations, convert those into affidavits on Election Day or the days following, and try to use that either to contest whether certain votes are counted in certain places\u2026 or to use that to try to pressure election officials and others not to certify results,\" Starbird said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nResearchers and election officials say that one of the most prominent narratives circulating this year is the unfounded claim that noncitizens are voting or that they are allowed to vote in federal elections, giving Democrats an unfair advantage in what is expected to be a very tight race.\n\nThat baseless narrative has emerged as the main focus of Republican efforts to lay the groundwork to challenge the election outcome if Trump loses, say election law experts. States have cited it as a justification to attempt to purge people from the rolls. Thousands of eligible voters were ensnared by such an effort in Alabama, according to court records. Eligible voters in Texas and Virginia have been removed too, although the total number affected isn't clear yet.\n\nThe votes of naturalized citizens aren't the only ones being challenged by baseless claims. The far-right outlet The Gateway Pundit alleged the methods that some members of the military and Americans living abroad used to vote are vulnerable to hacking, and accused Democrats of exploiting overseas ballots to invent votes.\n\nThose rumors also arose in 2020 and were debunked. A video Gateway Pundit cited as evidence was actually part of an Iranian influence operation called out by the Justice Department in 2021.\n\nBut Trump has recently repeated the false claim on his Truth Social platform. Republicans have filed lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of some ballots cast by U.S. citizens living abroad, though those challenges have not been successful.\n\n\n\nMisinterpreting real-life events, seeing routine work as fishy\n\nMany other false narratives about voting are also being recycled from past years. Rumors alleging that voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems were flipping votes spread on social media in recent days. That company was the target of conspiracy theories in 2020 that ultimately resulted in a $787 million defamation settlement by Fox News and multiple ongoing lawsuits.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe posts that accused the company claimed that the poster or a friend or relative were ultimately able to vote as they wanted when they noticed that the machine's printed out ballot didn't match their chosen candidate.\n\nBut even though voters were able to choose their preferred candidates, high-profile figures including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has regularly echoed conspiratorial narratives, continued to amplify the accusation that Dominion machines might be changing votes.\n\nIn statements to NPR, Dominion Voting Systems said its machines were not changing any votes and pointed to a page on its website addressing common rumors about the company titled \"Setting the Record Straight\".\n\ntoggle caption Olivier Touron\/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOther easily dispelled falsehoods have quickly gone viral. Republican activist Cliff Maloney, who organizes door knockers aiming to get Pennsylvanian Republicans to vote early, said that one of his contacts identified 53 voters registered at a monastery in Erie County where, the contact claimed, no one lived. The monastery \u2014 which in fact houses over 50 nuns \u2014 quickly put out a response correcting the claim, and CNN spoke with the sisters who were the listed registered voters.\n\nBut Maloney's response to being fact checked was to double down on his claim. \"WRONG,\" he wrote on X. The site's owner, Musk, amplified Maloney's initial claim, but there's no indication that he also shared the fact checks.\n\nIgnoring checks and remedies in place is another common theme of those trying to cast doubt on election results, University of Washington researchers wrote in a September blog post.\n\nHigh tension inspires high vigilance\n\nWith both parties telling their supporters to vote early, concerns about ballot drop boxes have also resurfaced. Drop boxes in three states have been set on fire. Starbird noted that rumors are starting to circulate around the incidents, but she said they, as well as isolated incidents of stolen ballots, miss a larger point.\n\n\"This is really problematic for the individuals, but it's unlikely to change the results of the election,\" she said, noting that one of the rhetorical strategies of election deniers is to exaggerate the impact of events.\n\nStarbird worries what constant vigilance about voter fraud is doing in a country steeped for years in Trump's false assertions that the election was stolen from him in 2020 \u2014 a worldview that has been embraced by many Republicans and that has dented many Americans' confidence in voting.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At its best, what this can do is quickly identify problems so that election officials can solve them. And that's what we want,\" she said. \"At its worst, what happens is these things get wrapped into these sort of false narratives, reinforce [them] and people begin to lose trust in the process.\"\n\nAnd that, Starbird said, \"can distract election workers and election officials from real problems.\"",

The online evidence gathering involves a lot of first-person accounts of people running into mistakes or things they didn\u2019t expect. A big narrative of this election is that noncitizens are voting in large numbers. \u201cTo be clear there have been incidents of noncitizens voting illegally, but it happens in very small numbers and there is no sign that it has affected election results,\u201d Jingnan says. This builds an impression that voter fraud is happening everywhere when in fact it\u2019s very rare.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNearly 40% of women under the age of 30 cite abortion as a top issue in this election. Abortion access will be directly on the ballot in 10 states next week. Vice President Harris has stated that if she is elected, she will restore reproductive freedom and sign a bill that enshrines the right to an abortion. In contrast, former President Donald Trump and his allies have discussed the possibility of implementing national abortion limits often referred to as a minimum national standard. However, Trump rolled that back on the campaign trail weeks ago, saying he would veto a federal abortion ban.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Harris wouldn\u2019t be able to expand abortion rights alone. She needs Congress\u2019 support, NPR\u2019s Elissa Nadworny says. Even if she could get something passed, she would face legal challenges and a now conservative Supreme Court. If Trump became president, he could limit abortion by enforcing an anti-obscenity law called the Comstock Act. It could be used to criminalize abortion by banning abortion pills and medical instruments needed for the procedure. Once in office, a president could use executive authority to strengthen privacy laws to protect women from prosecution. In contrast, the president could create abortion tracking requirements.\n\nA series of Facebook ads seemingly advocating for Harris are actually spreading misinformation about her current policy positions in an attempt to mislead voters. These ads, which have been viewed millions of times in swing states, are posted by an account called \u201cProgress 2028,\u201d which suggests a liberal counterpart to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025. The ads claim that Harris intends to implement a mandatory gun buyback program, provide Medicare benefits and driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants and ban fracking. Funding for these ads comes from a dark money group backed by Musk and others, according to the campaign tracking site Open Secrets.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nToday's listen\n\ntoggle caption Marizilda Cruppe for NPR\n\nThe Amazon River, the largest river in the world\u2019s biggest rainforest, is facing significant challenges.

        "full_text":"Meet the Democrats using porn ads to convince Trump voters to stay home\n\ntoggle caption FTW PAC\/Screenshot by NPR\n\nEarlier this year, Wally Nowinski and his buddy Matt Curry were texting back and forth about what they \u2014 two regular voters with no ties to any political campaign \u2014 could do to defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election.\n\n\"I'm in California, I could drive to Nevada and knock on doors or something, but I'm not going to reach 5 million people that way,\" Nowinski told NPR. Curry lives in New York.\n\nThe two friends work in tech with experience in digital advertising and startups, and Nowinski was particularly interested in what he calls \"sub-prime\" ad markets, aka porn sites.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPolitical candidates and their allied PACs don't advertise in these spaces because they don't want to associate their brands with explicit content, making the online pornographic market perhaps the last untouched frontier in political advertising.\n\nAccording to AdImpact, more than $10 billion will be spent in political ads in 2024 in all races across television, streaming, radio and digital platforms.\n\nWhile advertising in the Philadelphia suburbs, for instance, is quite expensive, ads on porn sites are inexpensive and have almost no competition. \"These ads are like real cheap and it's like weirdly relevant to this campaign,\" Nowinski said.\n\nThe relevance they saw was a market they believe can reach one of the key voter demographics in 2024.\n\n\"There\u2019s 3 million non-college white men across the 'blue wall' states, that's a lot of people, and they're probably breaking for Trump like 65-70%,\" he said. \"You only need to make a very few of them change their mind to possibly make an impact on the election.\"\n\nSo Nowinski and Curry did what virtually no regular voters do: They formed a political action committee and raised a modest $100,000. About $25,000 has already been spent in just the last few weeks of October, when inconsistent voters often decide whether to get off the couch or not. Nowinski says their ads have already notched 5 million views.\n\n\n\nSimple ads, carefully targeted\n\nOne of the hurdles was finding pornographic sites that would allow political advertising, which some of the largest distributors of pornography, like PornHub, do not allow. Then, Nowinski said, they had to be able to target the ads in the seven swing states, but with a heavy focus on the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where larger demographics of white men reside.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe ads are simplistic: a five second static image the viewer must see before they can hit \"skip\" to get to the video they\u2019re there to watch. The image has ominous music and features things like a woman in lingerie with this message: \"Trump\u2019s Project 2025 will ban porn. Enjoy while you can.\" The ads also instruct the viewer to \"Google Trump porn ban.\"\n\nTheir goal is also simple: Convince some of these Trump-leaning, porn-watching white guys to sit out the election.\n\n\"While this is certainly a different sort of approach, it's not unusual and it's smart in some ways, in a lot of ways it's smart to go where your audience is,\" said Steve Caplan, a professor at the University of Southern California, who is teaching a class this semester on political advertising in the 2024 campaign.\n\nTo be clear, Trump has not endorsed a pornography ban, and his campaign has repeatedly distanced itself from the conservative blueprint Project 2025, although it was crafted by Trump allies and it does call for all pornography to be outlawed.\n\n\"I think it's a fascinating example of how far campaign advertising, targeting and hyper targeting has evolved,\" said Caplan.\n\nWith $75,000 in the bank to spend by Election Day, Nowinski estimates their swing state ad campaign could hit 20 million views. He also says they'll probably keep the PAC alive after this election, but he's not sure where exactly to take it from here.\n\n\"I'll probably keep the PAC alive because there's other opportunities that are like niche efficiency plays, or kind of unexpected angles that I'd like to explore more potentially in future elections,\" he said.",

When a group of door knockers came to his neighborhood, he wasn\u2019t planning on having a conversation, either. But in the span of a couple minutes, he\u2019d agreed to both.\n\nBritton, a 28-year-old non-affiliated voter in Nash County, North Carolina, was pulling out of his driveway in a black SUV, airport bound, when a canvasser from the organization Down Home North Carolina approached his car.\n\n\u201cCan we get five minutes of your time?\u201d door knocker Alex Cook asked. Her plea for five minutes turned into a plea for two minutes, and Britton said yes. From the passenger side window, while Britton\u2019s car was still running, Cook made her case for why he should vote for the Democratic down-ballot candidates the organization had endorsed. She focused on the way the local races would impact health care, an issue that resonated with Britton.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cSo, do we have a vote from you?\u201d Cook asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got a vote from me,\u201d Britton said.\n\nTo Down Home North Carolina, the stakes of the 2024 election are too high to let a potential voter like Britton go. Nash County is near-evenly divided between white and Black residents, and in recent presidential elections, it was near-evenly divided by its results. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the rural county by two-tenths of a point. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won it by the exact razor-thin margin.\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\nIn the small town of Nashville, where the group canvassed that day, it did not feel evenly divided. There were Trump signs everywhere, and plenty of MAGA flags. Still, Down Home found plenty of Democratic and non-affiliated doors to knock on.\n\n\u201cWhat I noticed is that there's a lot of people who want to stay out the way,\u201d said Adon Bermudez-Bey, Down Home\u2019s regional field director. \u201cThey see the Trump signs, they see what's going on in the school boards, city council. They're just like, \u2018I'm going to stay out of it.\u2019 We're trying to tell them there's an organization that specifically focuses on rural areas to pull those folks out.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBermudez-Bey said Down Home\u2019s platform was \u201csurvival,\u201d helping poor and working class people get basic needs met like housing and education. In an election season like this one, the organization is mostly focused on local races, but they endorse candidates up and down the ticket, usually Democrats. Most of their time is spent urging residents \u2014 especially residents of color \u2014 to get out and vote.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t open the door all the time,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo one out of 10 doors, you might get someone.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina's state Democratic chair, Anderson Clayton, is also focused on turnout this election. The 26-year-old from rural Person County is the youngest state party chair in the country.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden lost the state by 74,000 votes in 2020, which we know is a field margin, and that can come from all of our counties across the state,\u201d Clayton told NPR in October.\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\nThere are potential barriers to getting those votes. North Carolina has some of the most extreme partisan-drawn maps in the nation. The state\u2019s governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat, but Republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse.\n\nStill, Clayton has made reaching out to rural Democrats a key part of her strategy. The stakes are clear: The Tarheel State has more rural voters than any other 2024 presidential swing state.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to win rural North Carolina this year. I'm trying to bring back margins in it,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere's a difference in trying to talk to rural voters and talking to rural Democrats. I'm trying to talk to rural Democrats this year. People that showed up in 2008 that ain't showed up since because they haven't had somebody to vote for and they didn't feel like their vote actually mattered.\u201d\n\nBack in Nashville, Down Home door knockers make their pitch to another resident. Sean Jones says he plans on voting, though in the presidential race, he hasn\u2019t made up his mind. He said he\u2019s leaning toward Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cI just recently went to go see my brother in prison this weekend, and he was kind of on my head about voting,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe wanted me to vote for Trump, but I still wanted to vote for Kamala. So I'm still trying to, like, look into the politics as far as what\u2019s what and who\u2019s who.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\nSo soon before Election Day, finding a true undecided voter can feel like a rarity. But Down Home encounters them all the time, even within their own ranks. Adon Bermudez-Bey, speaking only for himself and not for the organization, told NPR he\u2019s also undecided on the presidential race \u2014 even as he led a group of canvassers for an organization that has endorsed Harris.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI don't know if I'm voting for Kamala yet, just full transparency,\u201d Bermudez-Bey said. \u201cBut I know that I'm definitely not voting for Trump.\u201d\n\nBermudez-Bey cited his concerns about Harris\u2019 time as a prosecutor in California, and her support for Israel during the ongoing war in the Middle East. He set a deadline for himself: By the last day of early voting in North Carolina, he\u2019ll decide between Harris or a third-party candidate.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Bermudez-Bey said he still sees the merits of a Harris presidency \u2014 at least for Down Home\u2019s goals.\n\n\u201cNo, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a lot easier for us to organize under her presidency than Trump's,\u201d he said.\n\nThe motivation of voting against Trump, rather than for Harris, was in the air a dozen miles away at an early voting site in Rocky Mount, Nash County.\n\n\u201cI just feel like Donald Trump is for billionaires and not for working class people,\u201d said voter Lynn Jones, who spoke to NPR after casting her ballot for Harris.\n\nHer neighbor Donnell Jones, no relation, was by her side. He had just voted for the first time in his life. Lynn said the two of them had had a series of conversations in recent weeks about going to the polls together.\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR\n\n\u201cI just thought, you know, he was at an age where this just should have happened a lot sooner,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cBut I know sometimes people are stuck in their ways, so I didn't pressure him. Just, \u2018Hey, let's go vote together then.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat resulted in one more vote for Harris.\n\n\u201cI voted for the lady,\u201d Donnell said.\n\nIf Democrats win Nash County, and win North Carolina, it will be through thousands of interactions like what Down Home is doing \u2014 and on a more casual level, what Lynn Jones did with her neighbor Donnell. The key will be nudging others to show up and vote, regardless of how disengaged or skeptical they were at the beginning of those conversations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEarly voting in North Carolina ends on November 2. So far, more than 3.6 million voters have cast their ballots.",

Its plaque explains that it honors the \u201cbrave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021 to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThen, over the weekend, a plaza near the White House suddenly became host to a tall sculpture of a hand gripping a tiki torch, reminiscent of the torches that white supremacists held at the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally. Its plaque dedicates it to \u201cTrump and the \u2018very fine people\u2019 he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, two other satirical statues briefly popped up in Philadelphia and Portland, Ore., around the same time.\n\nBoth feature a life-sized model of a suit-clad Trump, were placed near an existing statue of a woman and are titled In Honor of a Lifetime of Sexual Assault. It shows him with a closed-mouth smile and one hand curled in what could be interpreted as a suggestive gesture.\n\nThe plaques also quote from the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which a hot mic captured him telling then-host Billy Bush about kissing women and grabbing them between their legs without permission, in crude terms.\n\n\u201c[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump said in the clip, which surfaced a month before the 2016 election. It earned him much criticism but didn\u2019t keep him out of the White House.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDozens of women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct dating back as far as the 1970s, which he has denied.\n\nFormer Sports Illustrated model Stacey Williams became the latest to accuse Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior last week, alleging he groped her in 1993 while Jeffrey Epstein, who was later convicted of sex offenses, looked on. Another, writer E. Jean Carroll, sued Trump twice for defamation after he denied sexually abusing her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in 1996 \u2014 for which a jury found him liable in 2023.\n\nThe Trump statue appeared on a Portland sidewalk on Sunday, an arm\u2019s length away from a sculpture of a nude woman that has been there since 1975.\n\nThat sculpture, Kvinneakt (\u201cnude woman\u201d in Norwegian), has its own storied history: It was featured in the \u201cExpose Yourself to Art\u201d poster in the 1970s, which showed future Portland Mayor Bud Clark flashing the woman in a raincoat.\n\nDecades later, the figure of Trump towering over the woman, with the two statues\u2019 bases touching, made for a strikingly similar image. But it didn\u2019t last long.\n\nThe Trump statue was beheaded by mid-afternoon, according to KOIN, and passersby dismantled it piece by piece throughout the day until \u201call that was left was one golden shoe.\u201d\n\nAt least one of the culprits was Portland City Council candidate and self-described \u201cfearless Trump supporter\u201d Brandon Farley.\n\nFarley tweeted a video of himself arriving at the scene of the already-headless statue and chipping away at what he described as the \u201cslanderous plaque,\u201d eventually tearing it off completely.\n\nThe second Trump statue was similarly short-lived.\n\nIt arrived in Philadelphia\u2019s Maja Park on Wednesday, according to BillyPenn at WHYY. It was placed about 15 feet behind, and facing, Maja, a statue of a nude woman with her eyes closed and arms above her head.\n\nThe Maja was sculpted by German artist Gerhard Marcks in the 1940s, and installed in the park in 2021.\n\nCity workers took the Trump statue down and put it into a pickup truck before noon, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the same artist or artists are behind all four installations. But the style of the bronze sculptures and the tone and font of their accompanying plaques look nearly identical.\n\nThe D.C. sculptures are intended to \u201cexpress the principles of democracy justice and freedom,\u201d a group called Civic Crafted LLC wrote in its request to display them in D.C. The National Park Service granted them a permit to display the torch until Thursday, and the desk until next Wednesday \u2014 the day after Election Day.",

However, for those who chose \"uncommitted\" \u2014 the majority of whom have voted Democratic in the past \u2014 support for Harris is by no means guaranteed in this key swing state, where she and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck.\n\nAll these months later, there is no cease-fire in Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza. In fact, it\u2019s expanded to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Calls to end or condition U.S. military aid to Israel over the level of civilians killed and infrastructure destroyed have gone largely unheeded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a tough moment. It feels like a moment of impossibility,\u201d said Abbas Alawieh, the co-founder of the Uncommitted Movement and a Democratic organizer. \u201cI'm feeling a certain level of despair, and I'm also feeling the contradictions of that despair being so rooted in the policy of our government to send weapons and bombs to kill people I love.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe unity that was so apparent in February among Arab Americans, young voters and other progressives in the Detroit metro area has fractured, and people are divided on how to express their objections to U.S. policy with their limited political power come Election Day.\n\ntoggle caption Elaine Cromie\/for NPR\n\n\u201cWhen [Harris] became the candidate, we made this offer that if you change the policy, then we\u2019ll automatically endorse you, and if you can\u2019t change the policy then give us something,\u201d Alawieh said, his face pale and his hands shaking as he spoke in a Dearborn cafe. \u201cNot only did they not give us anything, they actively worked to push voters for whom this is a top issue away.\u201d\n\nThe inability to get anything from Harris has diminished the credibility of this movement in the view of so many in his own community, home to the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Their families hail from the cities and towns being bombed by Israel right now. More than 2,700 people have been killed in a matter of weeks and over a million displaced, according to the country's Health Ministry.\n\nDespite Alawieh\u2019s pain over the deaths of his own family members in Lebanon and his displaced loved ones, he is still choosing Harris.\n\n\u201cI'm looking at Trump's plans, and I know it could get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is actively accepting contributions from people who want the full annexation of the West Bank. Trump, very importantly, has very specific plans for how he will criminalize our anti-war organizing here in this country. And that is a clear difference from Vice President Harris.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a choice that has isolated him. Alawieh\u2019s movement didn\u2019t endorse Harris but still warned against voting for a third party and of what it sees as the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cI've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?\u201d he said. \u201cI have a hard time figuring out how to respond to that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re voting for Trump and Stein\n\nPeople here don\u2019t use the word \u201cwar\u201d to describe what\u2019s happening in Gaza, where more than 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, aid has been intermittently blocked by Israel, hospitals bombed and people are trapped and unable to flee. They say genocide.\n\nIt\u2019s the subject of a case before the International Court of Justice and something Israel denies. Israel says it's going after Hamas which led the deadliest attack in that country\u2019s history that killed some 1,200 people and saw fighters take some 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.\n\nThe International Criminal Court's prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas officials over alleged war crimes.\n\nNow all those voters Alawieh helped mobilize just a few months ago are \u201cbeing left on the table\" by his party.\n\nAnd across the cafe, Samraa Luqman, a Yemeni American community organizer, is ready to pick those votes up for Trump.\n\nShe said she met with former President Trump recently in Dearborn, where he made a promise to her to end the war. That stands in stark contrast to his public statements, in which he said Israel should \u201cfinish the job\u201d and criticized Harris and Biden for calling for a cease-fire. At a rally for Trump just this weekend, speakers used racist and misogynistic rhetoric, including Rudy Giuliani. He demonized Palestinian toddlers, falsely claiming they are \u201ctaught to kill us at two years old.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Elaine Cromie\/for NPR\n\nAsked why, despite this rhetoric, she believes Trump\u2019s promise to end the war, Luqman says he\u2019s more likely to do so than Harris.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cBelieve him or not, if there is a 99% chance that Trump is going to continue the genocide and I have to weigh it against 100% chance that it's going to continue under Harris, I'm going to take the 99% chance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that there is that slight hope means that I need to go with the best thing for my people.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one making this calculation. This weekend, several prominent Arab and Muslim leaders endorsed Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan.\n\nLuqman\u2019s children are half-Palestinian, and this year of watching kids being killed is intolerable, she said. She blames the Biden administration and Harris directly for these deaths.\n\n\u201cIt hurts a lot. That hurt has transformed into rage,\u201d she said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to ensure Harris loses. Whatever I can do. And, I\u2019m still a Democrat.\u201d\n\nShe sees this as a path to building real political power for a community that has over 200,000 votes in Michigan. For context, Trump won this state by about 11,000 votes in 2016 and Biden won by over 150,000 in 2020.\n\ntoggle caption Elaine Cromie\/for NPR\n\n\u201cIf Muslims are credited with swinging an election,\u201d she said, \u201cimagine the political strength we're going to have. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to be vying for our vote.\u201d\n\nBut most Arab American and Muslim Americans NPR interviewed around Dearborn said that if they don\u2019t stay home on Election Day, they\u2019ll go with a third-party choice: Jill Stein.\n\nThe Green Party candidate has been actively campaigning in Michigan promising to \u201cend the genocide.\u201d\n\nShe has no chance of winning, but she could pull a chunk of support from Harris, and the Harris campaign is running out of time to win these voters over.\n\n\n\nSome see Harris as the \u201cstrategic choice\u201d\n\nIn the last few weeks, her campaign has made overtures. Last month, Harris met with some American Muslims and Arab Americans over an hour away in Flint. This weekend, a different group of Arab Americans endorsed Harris in Dearborn. They called her the strategic choice despite their disappointment. Trump, they said, has shown indifference to Palestinian suffering while promising mass deportations and the revival of a travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, known as the Muslim ban.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Harris campaign told NPR she is \u201ccommitted to earn every vote\u201d and that she has been steadfast in her support for American Muslims \u201cincluding ensuring that they can live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nSome American Muslims view this as Harris making a real effort despite having to uphold Biden\u2019s policies.\n\ntoggle caption Valaurian Waller for NPR\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not voting for Kamala because I\u2019m afraid of Trump. I see her as a great candidate,\u201d said Imam Mika\u2019il Stewart Saadiq, a Black Muslim leader born and raised in Detroit.\n\nHe is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.\n\n\u201cI don't think it's fair that we lay the blame of the mess of eight years of older white men at the feet of a Black woman in our generation who's saying cease-fire now before the president said it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe've seen what Trump can do. We've seen what Biden can do. Let's see what she can do.\u201d\n\nSaadiq voted uncommitted in the primary, but once Harris got on the ticket he got behind her.\n\n\u201cI respect people's righteous indignation and people saying I just can't vote. I'm never going to try and convince a Palestinian American that they should understand my political calculus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then when it comes to Trump and the MAGA beast at the gate, again we ask the question, OK, now are you asking me to sacrifice myself? Because remember, anti-Black racism, usually when you're darker, you get it the worst.\u201d\n\nHe shares a parable from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad to make his point. The story is about a boat with lower- and upper-deck passengers.\n\n\u201cWe're all in the same boat. We are Americans,\u201d Saadiq said. \u201cPeople at the bottom of the boat, they want water, so they're like, \u2018Hey, we have an idea. We're going to bust a hole in the bottom of the boat and get water.\u2019 If the people at the upper level don't stop them, then everybody sinks. So in this hysterical political climate, there are some of us that say, OK. Don't put the hole in the bottom of the boat. Don't sink everybody.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut with just days until the election and the war expanding, many Arab and Muslim American voters in this battleground state said they already feel like they\u2019re sinking.\n\nThis story was edited for digital by Majd Al-Waheidi.

        "full_text":"North Korea launches new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to threaten U.S.\n\ntoggle caption Lee Jin-man\/AP\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday in its first test in almost a year of a weapon designed to threaten the U.S. mainland and occurring days ahead of the U.S. election.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the missile test and was at the launch site, calling the launch \"an appropriate military action\" to show North Korea's resolve to respond to its enemies' moves that has threatened the North's safety, according to its Defense Ministry.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and Japan had also identified the weapon as an ICBM and condemned the launch as raising tensions. The launch came as Washington warned that North Korean troops in Russian uniforms are heading toward Ukraine, likely to augment Russian forces and join the war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNorth Korea confirmed the launch hours after its neighbors detected the firing of what they suspected was a new, more agile weapon targeting the mainland U.S. The statement was unusually quick since North Korea usually describes its weapons tests a day after they occur.\n\n\"I affirm that the DPRK will never change its line of bolstering up its nuclear forces,\" Kim said, according to a North Korean Defense Ministry statement carried by state media. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name.\n\ntoggle caption Korean Central News Agency\/KCNA via KNS\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea could have tested a new, solid-fueled long-range ballistic missile. Missiles with built-in solid propellants are easier to move and hide and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant weapons.\n\nJCS spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said the launch was possibly timed to the U.S. election in an attempt to strengthen North Korea's future bargaining power. He said the North Korean missile was launched on a high angle, apparently to avoid neighboring countries.\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters the missile's flight duration of 86 minutes and its maximum altitude of more than 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) exceeded corresponding data from previous North Korean missile tests. Lee, the South Korean military spokesperson, said South Korea has a similar assessment on Thursday's launch.\n\nKCNA said the flight characteristics of this launch exceeded those registered for its previous missile launches but did not detail the differences.\n\nU.S. National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett had called the launch \"a flagrant violation\" of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that \"needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.\" Savett said the U.S. will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and its South Korean and Japanese allies.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBoth South Korea and Japan condemned the North Korean launch for posing a threat to international peace and they said they're closely coordinating with the U.S. over the latest North Korean weapons test. Lee said that South Korea and the U.S. plan \"sufficient\" bilateral military exercises and trilateral ones involving Japan in response to North Korean threats.\n\ntoggle caption Korea Central News Agency\/KCNA via KNS\n\nLee said the missile may have been fired from a 12-axle launch vehicle, the North's largest mobile launch platform that it disclosed in September. The vehicle's unveiling had prompted speculation North Korea could be developing an ICBM that is bigger than its existing ones.\n\nNorth Korea has made strides in its missile technologies in recent years, but many foreign experts believe the country has yet to acquire a functioning nuclear-armed missile that can strike the U.S. mainland. They say North Korea likely possesses short-range missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes across all of South Korea.\n\nOne of the technological hurdles North Korea still faces is for its weapons to be capable of surviving the harsh conditions of atmospheric reentry. South Korean officials and experts earlier said North Korea may test-launch a ICBM on a normal angle to verify that capability.\n\nLee said a high-angle launch like Thursday's test cannot examine a missile's reentry vehicle technology. He said that more analysis is required to find why North Korea didn't conduct a standard-trajectory launch on Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea's military intelligence agency told lawmakers Wednesday that North Korea was close to test-firing a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States and has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.\n\nNorth Korea last test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in December 2023, when it launched the solid-fueled Hwasong-18.\n\ntoggle caption Korean Central News Agency\/KCNA via KNS\n\nIn the past two years, Kim has used Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a window to ramp up weapons tests and threats while also expanding military cooperation with Moscow. South Korea, the U.S. and others have recently accused North Korea of dispatching thousands of troops to support Russia's warfighting against Ukraine. They've said North Korea has already shipped artillery, missiles and other convectional arms to Russia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNorth Korea's possible participation in the Ukraine war would mark a serious escalation. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what North Korea could get from Russia in return for joining Russia's war against Ukraine. Aside from his soldiers' wages, experts say Kim Jong Un likely hopes to get high-tech Russian technology that can perfect his nuclear-capable missiles and build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Kim could also want Russian fighter jets and help to modernize North Korea's conventional weapons.\n\nOn Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said North Korean troops wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment are moving toward Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin said \"the likelihood is pretty high\" that Russia will use the troops in combat.\n\nAustin spoke at a news conference in Washington with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol last week raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while stressing that his government \"won't sit idle\" over North Korea's reported troop dispatch.\n\nSouth Korea said Wednesday that North Korea has sent more than 11,000 troops to Russia and that more than 3,000 of them have been moved close to battlefields in western Russia.",

        "full_text":"Pushed by public opinion shift, Democrats adopt immigration restrictions\n\ntoggle caption Jim Watson\/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhen President Biden took office on Jan. 20, 2021, he did what he had promised: he rescinded many of former President Donald Trump\u2019s draconian immigration policies.\n\nBut three years into his presidency, Biden and the Democratic leadership changed its approach to immigration, focusing heavily on enforcement, restrictions, and punishments \u2014 a strategy at times indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Their positions have moved significantly to the right in part due to Republican attacks and changing public views on border security.\n\nThis has left immigration rights advocates wondering whether Democrats will focus again on providing pathways to legal status for millions of unauthorized migrants in the U.S.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is that the center of the Democratic Party is now adopting the same policies, the same postures, that MAGA Republicans were fighting for about six years ago,\u201d Elora Mukherjee, the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told NPR.\n\nSome immigrant rights advocates say misinformation, as well as a record number of unauthorized crossings during the Biden administration, have put Democrats in a position where they have to prove they can be tough at the border.\n\nAdd to that: Republican-led states have been trying to regulate immigration on their own.\n\nAn \"outdated\" approach\n\nIn the last six months, Biden issued a number of executive actions that mimic those from the Trump administration, including limiting most asylum petitions at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThat proposal went into effect in the summer and temporarily suspended the processing of most asylum claims after the seven-day average of unauthorized crossings in the southern border exceeded 2,500.\n\nThis was the same rule Trump used in 2017 to ban immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries, and again in 2018 suspending the right to petition asylum for migrants crossing the border illegally.\n\nPrior to 2024, Biden was already adopting some of Trump\u2019s immigration proposals: he kept Title 42 in place for two years , a provision meant to quickly turn back migrants to Mexico for public health reasons.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAndrea Flores, who served as the director of border management on the National Security Council under the Biden administration, said Democrats continue to use an \u201coutdated\u201d approach first used by former President Barack Obama, and expanded by Trump, \u201cthat is all about asylum and restricting asylum, and blocking people from being able to raise asylum claims.\u201d\n\nFlores said for the last decade, both Democrats and Republicans have looked at the issue of border security through the lens of limiting or expanding access to asylum.\n\n\u201cBut that isn\u2019t really a full answer on the challenges we see at the border,\u201d Flores said. \u201cIt\u2019s less about how Democrats have shifted \u2014 it's more about why we aren\u2019t talking about better solutions than the same policies that have already failed to create order at the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d\n\nThere have been some advancements, Flores concedes.\n\nAn example, she says, are Biden\u2019s policies that have reduced the number of unauthorized crossings while protecting migrants fleeing their countries. The humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans allows up to 30,000 eligible migrants a month to come to the U.S. for up to two years after being vetted.\n\nThe idea behind the program is to reduce the number of migrants attempting to come to the U.S. illegally.\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council , nearly 500,000 migrants from those four countries have come to the U.S. in the last two years under the humanitarian parole program.\n\n\u201cThat innovation, more than any asylum restriction in the last 10 years, led to the most sustainable drop in those people making unauthorized crossings at the border,\u201d Flores said.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security , encounters with migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua between ports of entry are down 99 percent since the program started. Earlier last month the White House announced it would not renew the legal status of those in the country under the parole program.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhite House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez told NPR in a statement that the Biden administration \u201chas put forward a balanced approach in order to secure our border and make our immigration system more fair and just.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Qian Weizhong\/VCG via Getty Images\n\nHe said the most recent policies have led to a decrease of more than 55 percent in unlawful crossings at the southern U.S. border.\n\nIn December, border agents processed nearly 250,000 migrants, a record high. But those numbers have dropped dramatically since Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions. In September, the number of migrants processed was about 54,000.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez said the White House continues to call on Congress to \u201creform our broken immigration system, pass the bipartisan Senate bill, and provide the funding we have requested for additional border security personnel and resources.\u201d\n\nThat bipartisan border agreement had initial support in the Senate , but got derailed after Trump persuaded House Republicans to oppose it.\n\nThat legislation would have overhauled the asylum system, imposing severe restrictions for those seeking asylum, and would have raised the initial credible fear threshold for migrants. It would have also increased detention capacity.\n\nThe proposal would have also created a pathway to citizenship for Afghan evacuees and allies.\n\nBut the Democrats' approach has created uncertainty, said Mukherjee, with Columbia Law School.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of fear \u2026 in immigrant communities across the country with the impending election,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cBecause no matter who takes office, we are very likely to see massive changes in the immigration system.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s impact on Democratic policies\n\nFor many immigration observers, the positions taken by Democrats over the last decade seem to contrast with the policies proposed by the leaders they once saw as close allies.\n\nBruna Sollod is with United We Dream Action, the political arm of an immigrant youth-led advocacy organization. Her organization was key in lobbying Obama to launch in 2012 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nShe says the way Republicans have mischaracterized the increase of migrant crossings along the southern U.S. border has pushed Democrats to take more restrictive actions.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party, the MAGA Republicans, have been so strategic in lying to the American people about this crisis at the border that now everyone believes this thing is happening when it\u2019s not,\u201d Sollod said.\n\nAccording to survey results released by the Pew Research Center last month, an overwhelming majority of Trump and Harris\u2019 supporters are in favor of \u201cimproving border security.\u201d\n\nNearly 30 percent of Harris\u2019 supporters back mass deportations, the Pew survey found.\n\nSollod says she believes that Democrats have been left with trying to be \u201cseen as tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing is, you are never going to be seen tougher on immigration than Donald Trump, who has promised mass detention and deportation of people,\u201d Sollod said.\n\nCongressman Greg Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says Trump\u2019s focus on false narratives about immigrants is one of the reasons the conversation around immigration has changed so much.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 response, in my view, should be to provide a vision of what a functional, orderly, lawful, and humane immigration system could look like,\u201d Casar said.\n\nThat includes, Casar says, pathways to citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party should be able to play offense on that issue,\u201d Casar said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think, Trump\u2019s relentless fear mongering and scapegoating in the immigrant communities has pushed the Democratic Party into being more fractured on this issue than we need to be.\u201d\n\ntoggle caption Melina Mara\/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nCautious optimism on Harris\n\nMany immigrant rights activists are cautiously optimistic about what a Harris presidency could mean for immigration.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined a request for comment and referred NPR to remarks the vice president made in Arizona last month . There, she called for revamping the immigration system. She vowed more punitive measures for migrants who cross without authorization, and called for a pathway to citizenship for \u201chard-working immigrants who have been here for years.\u201d\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSollod, with United We Dream Action, said many of Harris\u2019 policies don't fully align with her group\u2019s priorities, but she said she believes a potential Harris administration could be persuaded to pursue more progressive policies.\n\n\u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy, because it never is,\u201d Sollod said. \u201cPoliticians, I\u2019ve learned through this work, never do anything out of the kindness of their hearts \u2014 they do things when they are pushed.\u201d",

The series has already covered each how each candidate is expected to impact investments, overall costs, housing, and taxes.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have both talked about the importance of making childcare more affordable. Harris has put forth specific plans to help alleviate the high costs of raising children, while Trump's campaign has focused mainly on increasing the amount of the child tax credit.\n\nBelow are three elements of the childcare equation and what the Harris and the Trump camps have either proposed or already done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildcare-cost assistance\n\nHarris has promised to cap families' childcare costs at no more than 7% of their incomes, compared to the between 8% and 19.3% spent by the median American family in 2022. The policy was first proposed in President Joe Biden's 2021 Build Back Better package but was not passed by Congress.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAs vice president, Harris said she's working to encourage states to lower childcare costs by cutting copayments for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \u2014 a federal program that provides childcare subsidies for low-income families. Harris wants to make these subsidies more accessible for families of children who have disabilities, are experiencing homelessness, or are in foster care, and families living at or below 150% of the federal poverty line.\n\nTrump has not included a specific policy to mitigate childcare costs in his 2024 campaign. While in office, Trump expanded the child tax credit, but he made no other major policy changes.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris have proposed plans to fund childcare facilities or boost hiring, though experts told BI that skyrocketing costs are in part because the industry is underfunded. The number of childcare workers is still below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What's partially driving that conundrum is that we put so much burden right now on parents \u2014 and parents alone \u2014 to foot the bill for childcare,\" said Anne Hedgepeth, the senior vice president of policy and research at the advocacy organization Child Care Aware of America.\n\nCindy Lehnhoff, the director of the advocacy group National Child Care Association, said that previous federal funding pools, such as the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, helped to fund childcare facilities at the local and federal levels. She said more plans like it in the future could expand childcare options and make it more affordable for parents.\n\nChild tax credits\n\nTrump and Harris have both proposed expanding the child tax credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child.\n\nHarris' child tax credit policy would restore the enhanced pandemic-era credit, giving parents up to $3,600 annually per child, with the amount dependent on a child's age and family income. The plan also includes a $6,000 tax credit for middle- and low-income families for the first year of their child's life, which Harris said can be used to offset expenses like diapers, car seats, baby formula, and childcare. She has also proposed other tax cuts for middle- and low-income Americans, which would benefit some parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August, the vice presidential candidate JD Vance floated a child tax credit proposal that would include $5,000 per child for families of all income levels. Previously, Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided about $2,000 of relief per eligible child, though the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the plan excluded some low-income families and single-parent households.\n\nThe US's pandemic-era child tax credit expired at the end of 2021 because Republicans in Congress opposed it. A renewed one \u2014 which would have boosted the amount of money families receive \u2014 was introduced to Congress earlier this year, but it failed to pass the Senate.\n\nPaid leave\n\nDuring her run for president in 2020, Harris supported a six-month paid-leave policy for Americans with a new child or a sick relative. Protecting paid leave at the federal level has been one of her key 2024 talking points, and she's expected to build on Biden's agenda, which supported 12 weeks of paid parental leave.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed a bipartisan bill that provided federal employees with 12 weeks of paid parental leave. He hasn't emphasized the issue on the campaign trail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile parents are legally allowed to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the US does not have a federal paid-leave policy. Some states have their own paid-leave requirements, and others leave policies up to individual employers.\n\nWithout federal paid-leave protections, many families would not have access to parental leave \u2014 which could lead to higher childcare costs and lower job security.",

JD Vance of Ohio called on Americans to toughen up.\n\n\"I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America. I'm just \u2014 I'm so over it,\" said Vance, the GOP's vice presidential nominee. \"Our country was built by frontiersmen who conquered the wilderness. We are not going to restore the greatness of American civilization if we get offended at every little thing.\"\n\nVance was responding to a question about comedian Tony Hinchliffe's joke about Puerto Rico being a \"floating island of garbage\" at a Trump rally the previous day.\n\nBy Tuesday, Vance himself seemed offended, taking to X to weigh in on a clip of President Joe Biden responding to the Hinchcliffe controversy \u2014 and appearing to refer to former President Donald Trump's supporters as garbage. \"This is disgusting,\" Vance wrote. \"There's no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the final week of the 2024 presidential election, fury and indignation have been the name of the game, with one outrage cycle leading almost seamlessly into the next \u2014 and both sides doing their best to capitalize on the moment at each turn.\n\nHinchliffe's Puerto Rico joke spawned the initial news cycle (and within 24 hours, a new digital ad from Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign). Then came Biden's own gaffe on Tuesday night (the White House has insisted that he was referring to Hinchliffe's \"demonization of Latinos.\") Seizing on the moment, Trump climbed into a garbage truck branded with his campaign's logo in Wisconsin on Wednesday.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut at a rally soon after, clad in the bright-orange vest of a garbage truck operator, Trump said he would protect women \"whether the women like it or not,\" which Harris and her campaign quickly sought to amplify, casting the remarks as an attack on women's agency and autonomy.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump and his allies got their own talking point on women when billionaire investor Mark Cuban, a highly visible Harris supporter, went on \"The View.\" When Cuban was asked why Trump hadn't campaigned with former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, he said that people \"never see\" Trump \"around strong, intelligent women.\" That's since led to a flood of social media posts and op-eds from female GOP politicians. Cuban apologized, saying he'd unintentionally \"set myself up\" for a negative sound bite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, no one heeded Vance's call \u2014 including the Ohio senator himself. The motivation for both campaigns to harness outrage to their advantage in the closing days of the election is simply too strong.\n\nIn a statement for this story, RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly said that Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden was \"historic\" while hitting Harris. \"Her top surrogates called half of America 'garbage' and women who support President Trump weak and dumb,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's all about breaking through the noise\n\nThe last week has been all about candidates trying to create \"breakthrough moments\" to benefit their campaigns, leveraging instances where a candidate or someone associated with them was seen as demeaning a large swath of the American public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a lot of noise in the course of a presidential campaign, with candidates (and their surrogates) giving interviews and appearing at rallies virtually every day. For the average voter, particularly those who are less engaged, it's pretty easy to tune it all out \u2014 unless there's a moment when one particular event dominates headlines, filters down organically to social media, and spurs conversations at dinner tables.\n\nSome breakthrough moments are naturally built into the campaign schedule. Historically, candidates have received a \"convention bump\" in their polling after their respective nominating conventions, driven by the largely positive coverage that blankets TV networks, newspapers, and, increasingly, social media.\n\nDebates also provide natural breakthrough moments, with tens of millions of voters tuning in to watch the candidates face off. But the last debate was one month ago, and the broad contours of the race have remained relatively static since then.\n\nThat leaves it to each campaign to try to generate their own moments, like when Trump did a photo-op at McDonald's. If that fails, they can try to leverage other developments to their advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth candidates tried to do that this week. Trump's Madison Square Garden rally was supposed to spur media coverage about his inroads with voters who aren't traditionally Republican, while Harris's Ellipse rally was supposed to highlight January 6 and her campaign's closing message.\n\nIn both cases, they were upstaged by secondary moments that their opponents successfully latched onto, with Hinchcliffe drowning out Trump's rally and Biden spoiling Harris' rally.\n\nOutrage is a powerful motivator in politics, and over the last several days, both campaigns have tried to keep up the momentum. It's not hard to see why: In recent memory, both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have suffered as the result of gaffes made late in the campaign, whether it was Mitt Romney's \"47%\" comment in 2012 or Hillary Clinton's \"basket of deplorables\" comment in 2016.\n\nAnd in an election where the media ecosystem is more fragmented than before, social media virality and \"meme\" value are especially important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's why Trump donned a bright orange vest and climbed into a garbage truck, and it's why his supporters are responding to Cuban's comments with a social media campaign. These sorts of moments generate far more attention than a policy rollout.\n\nIn short, with just four days to go until Election Day, don't be surprised if we see one or two more last-minute outrage cycles before then.",

When she arrives, she's thrust into managing the fallout of an attack on a British aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf.\n\nHer diplomatic appointment serves a secondary purpose, however: the White House is grooming her to potentially step in as the new vice president, because the current one has a scandal hanging over her head that will force her to resign.\n\nThe series, helmed by \"The West Wing\" and \"Homeland\" vet Debora Cahn, plays like a familiar, soapy political drama. And it clearly resonates with viewers \u2014 according to Netflix's engagement data, it racked up over 214 million hours of viewing time in the first half of 2023. It's also a player on the awards scene, picking up Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for its first season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason two arrives just days before the United States election, and digs deeper into Kate's secondary purpose in London. As she unravels the conspiracy behind the aircraft attack, she also has to contend with Vice President Grace Penn (an excellent Allison Janney) showing up in London. By the end of the season, Kate and Grace have gotten to know each other \u2014 but a development in the series finale fundamentally changes their relationship.\n\nWarning: Major spoilers for the season two finale of \"The Diplomat\" ahead.\n\nKeri Russell and Allison Janney as Kate and Grace in \"The Diplomat.\" Netflix\n\nA major death in the season finale throws Grace and Kate into chaos\n\nKate learns that the aircraft carrier attack, which was executed by a Russian mercenary, was a false flag. Right-wing figure Margaret Roylin confesses to Tory Prime Minister Nicolas Trowbridge, whom she previously advised, that she orchestrated the entire incident to help the United Kingdom rally behind Trowbridge \u2014 and specifically, to prevent Scottish succession. The attack, however, was much more severe than intended, killing British sailors in the process, and Trowbridge reacts with abject fury and attempts to choke Roylin with his own hands.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate warms to Grace Penn, the vice president, after she arrives in London. After seeing Grace interact with Trowbridge, Kate decides to stop pursuing the vice presidency, and moves to recommend that Grace stay in office. Her husband Hal stops her from doing so, and delivers a devastating bit of information: Roylin didn't mastermind the attack on the aircraft carrier \u2014 Grace Penn did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the season finale, Kate signals to Grace that she's aware of her involvement in the incident. In turn, Grace explains that she had no other choice. Like Roylin, she wished to prevent Scottish secession, but not for the same reasons.\n\nScotland, Grace explains, is home to the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons, and houses the only place in Europe where the United States can dock its own nuclear submarines. That base, Creegan, would be the first European targets in a nuclear war with Russia, Grace explains, and should Scotland secede the country would be quick to close it.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKate understands Grace's rationale, but makes the decision to report her actions to the State Department. She enlists her husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) to tell the secretary of state on her behalf, so that her record is clean when she steps into the vice presidency. As Kate assures Grace that she won't tell anyone \u2014 and that she's stopped pursuing the VP job \u2014 Hal goes rogue and skips over the secretary of state to go straight to President William Rayburn.\n\nThat backfires spectacularly, because Hal's revelation is so uniquely upsetting that it causes the elderly president to die on the spot. Hal barely manages to give Kate the heads up over the phone before secret service members rush onto the lawn to collect Grace, the new president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I got chills and I threw the script across the room and I was like, 'What the fuck?'\" Janney told Vanity Fair of the ending. \"It was the best moment I've ever had reading a script.\"\n\nAllison Janney as Grace Penn in \"The Diplomat.\" Netflix\n\nThe VP job is open, but it may not be Kate's for the taking\n\nLuckily for us, \"The Diplomat\" has already been renewed for a third season that's already in production in New York. Russell told Rolling Stone that she's already read all of season three.\n\n\"It's so good in the way I want things to be good, and I just can't believe that it's still getting better,\" she said.\n\nNow that Grace is the president, the VP job is wide open \u2014 but it may not necessarily be Kate's for the taking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the twenty-fifth amendment of the United States Constitution: \"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, Kate and Grace aren't on the best terms. Just before learning of the president's death, Grace told Kate in no uncertain terms that she needs to back off from her job. And of course, Kate threw Grace under the bus by way of Hal. Still, that crisis led to Grace not only retaining her job, but getting promoted \u2014 so perhaps, in a roundabout way, Kate's stunt engendered some good will.\n\nUltimately, season two ending feels a bit on the nose, given that it premiered five days before the United States presidential election. It's not hard to wonder if President Joe Biden's age, itself a crucial issue before he stepped out of the race, influenced the show's characterization of President Rayburn. Season two was written and shot when Biden was still the Democrats' presumptive nominee for 2024, and Kamala Harris was an inspiration for Grace's character, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nStill, the timing and circumstances were a bit uncanny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a little bit terrifying, because we didn't want to really be doing a 'rip from the headlines' thing,\" Cahn, the showrunner, told Deadline. \"The idea is always to find a way into the headspace of the country and the audience, and what are we all thinking about right now, in particular the world of foreign policy.\"\n\n\"The Diplomat\" season two is streaming in full on Netflix.",

        "full_text":"By Felix Light\n\nTBILISI (Reuters) -Two U.S. pollsters commissioned by Georgian opposition forces called into question official results that showed the governing Georgian Dream party won last weekend's parliamentary election in the South Caucasus country, as opposition parties prepared to hold a new protest next week.\n\nU.S. data and polling firm Edison Research, commissioned by the pro-opposition television channel Formula, said the differences between its own exit poll and the official results pointed to \"manipulation\" of the vote.\n\nOn Thursday, HarrisX, another U.S. pollster that ran an exit poll for pro-opposition television channel Mtavari Arkhi, said the official results were \"statistically impossible\".\n\nWidely seen as pivotal for the former Soviet republic, the election offered a choice between further European integration under the pro-Western opposition, or closer ties with Moscow under a governing party that critics say is increasingly authoritarian.\n\nObserver groups, including the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, have said violations such as ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation and bribery could have swayed the election, but stopped short of saying it was outright stolen. Russia has denied interfering in the election.\n\nBoth HarrisX and Edison had predicted that Georgia's four main opposition parties would together have a parliamentary majority. A third exit poll, carried out by Georgian pollster GORBI for the pro-government Imedi television station, predicted Georgian Dream would take 56% of the vote.\n\nGeorgia's pro-Western president has denounced the election as fraudulent and thousands gathered after the vote in Tbilisi, the capital, to express discontent and are due to do so again on Monday.\n\nGeorgia's electoral commission has said the ruling Georgian Dream party, seen as being controlled by billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, won with 54% of the vote.\n\nGeorgian Dream, which has deepened ties with Russia while angering the West by passing laws Washington and Brussels do not like, says the election was free and fair.\n\nPOLLSTERS' CRITICISM\n\nEdison Research's own exit poll showed Georgian Dream taking only 41% of the vote.\n\n\"The 13-point difference between Edison\u2019s estimate and the official result of 54% for Georgian Dream cannot be explained by normal variation alone and suggests local-level manipulation of the vote,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIt \"found that the deviation from statistically expected results was widespread but most pronounced at specific polling locations in rural areas.\"\n\nThese sites were the most likely to have experienced significant vote manipulation, it said.\n\nGeorgian Dream underperformed in larger cities, but drew margins of up to 90% in some rural areas.\n\nGeorgian Dream and the election panel did not immediately comment on the pollsters' statements.\n\nGeorgian media cited Mamuka Mdinaradze, a senior ruling party MP, as saying Georgian Dream had been the victim of voter fraud by opposition supporters, and that its true vote share had been even higher. He provided no evidence to that effect.\n\nOn Thursday, HarrisX also questioned the results, citing \"statistically unexplainable discrepancies\".\n\nAccording to the electoral commission, Georgian Dream received 1.12 million votes, outpolling the four main opposition parties combined by 335,000 votes.\n\nIn Marneuli, a heavily ethnic Azeri district where authorities confirmed instances of ballot-stuffing and violence on election day, HarrisX's exit poll gave the ruling party only 40% of the vote. Official results ultimately gave it 80% there.\n\nOn Friday, Georgian media reported that a court had ordered two men, including the Georgian Dream deputy chairman of Marneuli's local council, arrested for ballot-stuffing at one polling station in the town.\n\nVideo of the incident circulated on election day, and the electoral commission ordered the precinct's results invalidated.\n\nGeorgian state prosecutors say they have launched an investigation into allegations of falsification after Western countries called for a probe.\n\n(Reporting by Felix Light; Editing by Tom Hogue, Clarence Fernandez, Andrew Osborn and Timothy Heritage)",

He declined to specify which plants may run Tuesday.\n\nAt Ford Motor Co., spokeswoman Jessica Enoch told the Free Press, \"Ford\u2019s U.S. manufacturing facilities will not run production on Election Day, with the exception of Kentucky Truck Plant, which will run with voluntary overtime. Federal Election Day is a holiday for Ford\u2019s U.S. salaried employees.\"\n\nShe said Ford has honored Election Day as a holiday since 1999.\n\nAt Stellantis, spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said the down day will have \"no impact to operations outside the U.S.\" The company did not say whether the automaker is seeking volunteers to keep some production going.\n\nBut a down day might help, given that Stellantis, which makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands, has been struggling to manage its inventory levels, particularly in the United States in recent months. It has paused or adjusted production at various plants in response.\n\nEmployers are not legally required to provide time off so employees can cast their ballots, but a growing number of companies are offering paid time off to do so. According to Time to Vote, a business-led, nonpartisan group working to get people to the polls, about 2,020 companies have pledged to give their employees at least a few hours off Tuesday to vote.\n\nAccording to an article this week by the Society for Human Resource Management, for the first time, furniture company Ikea will give its employees who work 20 hours a week or more two hours of paid time off Tuesday to vote.\n\nPublic support has grown over the years for companies to ensure that employees have time off to vote. Earlier this year, a survey from the Pew Research Center found that 72% of U.S. citizens supported making Election Day a national holiday. That is up from 65% in 2018. It found that 78% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans favor it.\n\nMore:Workers at GM pickup plant authorize strike over managers working assembly line\n\nMore:Stellantis to close Arizona Proving Grounds and sell the property\n\nContact Jamie L.

        "full_text":"U.S. businesses added only 12,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department announced Friday, in a weak final jobs report heading into the final days of the presidential election. But experts say a pair of major hurricanes and labor strikes in manufacturing, hotels, and cargo transport obscure the view of the economy \u2013 a key issue for voters picking who should lead the country.\n\nThe unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% after falling a tenth of a percentage point the prior two months.\n\nStrikes in October made it challenging to meaningfully understand the \u201cabysmal\u201d jobs number, said Lauren Saidel-Baker, an economist at ITR Economics, a nonpartisan economic research and consulting firm based in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really where we see the difference between, say, the unemployment rate \u2013 that was steady at 4.1% \u2013 against this very disappointing jobs figure,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are two different surveys. One is from households and one is from businesses, and so with a strike, a striking worker can say, \u2018I\u2019m still employed. I haven\u2019t lost my job. I\u2019m just temporarily absent from it.\u2019 Whereas the employer says they\u2019re not here, they\u2019re not working. This isn\u2019t a job.\u201d\n\nThe number of jobs added was far below Goldman Sachs analysts\u2019 forecast of 95,000 jobs this month.\n\nManufacturing jobs fell by 46,000 last month, with the vast majority of these numbers reflecting a massive strike. Job growth was projected to fall by at least 50,000 jobs or more in October in most estimates, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning economic think tank. The number of hours worked was also expected to change, but average weekly hours remained the same.\n\nTens of thousands of machinists at Boeing have been on strike since September for increased pay and better retirement benefits in September. Hotel chain workers have also been striking over health benefits and hiring to lessen the workload after COVID-19 pandemic-related staffing cuts. The unemployment rate for leisure and hospitality was 6% compared to 5.5% a year ago. In early October, dockworkers stopped work for a few days for better wages and a ban on automation.\n\nHurricane Helene ripped a path from Florida to the Carolinas in late September and is blamed for more than 200 deaths. Hurricane Milton followed just weeks later in October, devastating more communities in Florida.\n\nEconomists expected to see this show up in the jobs data.\n\nCarlos Martin, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, said that although climate displacement of households is an issue, a lot of people stay where their job is. But if their job no longer exists because businesses have left or ended operations, that could mean a lot for the population.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious on how [the hurricanes] affects the businesses there, including the small and medium-sized businesses. Are they going to leave?,\u201d he said.\u201cIf businesses aren\u2019t coming back, employment is not going to be maintained or go up in these places. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to have major population loss.\u201d.\n\nMany of the same trends seen in past jobs reports continued in October\u2019s report, including the addition of jobs in healthcare, government, and construction, but professional and business services fell by 49,000 jobs.\n\nWages rose 0.4% in October and increased 4% over the past year. The labor force participation rate and employment-population ratio, which have been strong in past reports, did not change significantly over the past month or past year.\n\nThe category of permanent job losers, or people who did not voluntarily end their employment and who began looking for work, also increased, to 1.8 million in October. Saidel-Baker said that although this is something to watch for in future reports, she doesn\u2019t see it as something to worry about now.\n\nEconomists are also watching the jobs report closely to see what influence it may have on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut its key rate, which affects everything from credit cards to mortgage rates. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index fell to 2.1% year over year in September \u2014 low enough for economists to argue that the Fed should get ready to take deeper cuts.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report shows that the two hurricanes we just experienced had sizable impacts on people\u2019s ability to continue working. While that damage will likely be limited to this month\u2019s report, job growth has been slowing in recent months and the Federal Reserve should not use it as an excuse to delay their planned rate cuts,\u201d Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told States Newsroom on Friday.\n\nBut the Fed will likely not make any big changes in their decision-making due to one jobs report, particularly one this messy, Saidel-Baker said.\n\n\u201cI think the Fed has signaled pretty clearly that they will not be hanging on this one jobs number,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know everything that went into it, the hurricanes, the Boeing strike, etc.\u201d\n\nMillions of people have already cast their ballots through the mail or early voting, and the final day of voting in the U.S. is Tuesday.",

        "full_text":"Michael Wolff, the explosive chronicler of Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, has released what he says is a recording of Jeffrey Epstein, who died in 2019, discussing Trump\u2019s then-White House team in detail.\n\nWolff released the tape on his podcast, Fire and Fury. He says it was made in a restaurant in 2017, most probably in the SoHo branch of Ladur\u00e9e, a patisserie in Manhattan. Epstein can be heard speaking over the din of diners.\n\n\u201cHis people fight each other,\u201d Epstein tells Wolff on the recording, \u201cand then he [Trump] poisons the well outside.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe will tell ten people \u2018Bannon\u2019s a scumbag\u2019 and \u2018Priebus is not doing a good job\u2019 and \u2018Kellyanne has a big mouth\u2019\u2014what do you think? Jamie Dimon [CEO of JPMorgan Chase] says that you\u2019re a problem and I shouldn\u2019t keep you. And I spoke to [financier] Carl Icahn. And Carl thinks I need a new spokesperson.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cSo Kelly[anne]\u2014even though I hired Kellyanne\u2019s husband\u2014Kellyanne is just too much of a wildcard. And then he tells Bannon, you know I really want to keep you but Kellyanne hates you.\u201d\n\nEpstein is referring to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, whose then-husband, George Conway, was briefly considered for positions in Trump\u2019s Department of Justice.\n\nThe recording seems to show that Epstein and Trump were close enough for the disgraced sex offender to know how Trump ruled his White House: by dividing and conquering his staff.\n\nReince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway and, to the right, Steve Bannon watch on as Trump signs an Executive Order in the Oval Office in January 2017. Pool\/Getty Images\n\nWolff said he had around \u201c100 hours of Epstein talking about the inner workings of the Trump White House and about his long standing, deep relationship with Donald Trump.\u201d Wolff has not provided anything more than this snippet of Epstein speaking in 2017.\n\nEpstein had wanted Wolff to write his biography. (He also wanted the New York Times reporter James B. Stewart, the author of DisneyWar, to do so.)\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the national press secretary for Trump\u2019s 2024 election campaign, responded to Wolff\u2019s claims, and the recording, in a statement to the Daily Beast:\n\n\u201cMichael Wolff is a disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books because he clearly has no morals or ethics. He waited until days before the election to make outlandish false smears all in an effort to engage in blatant election interference on behalf of Kamala Harris. He\u2019s a failed journalist that is resorting to lying for attention.\u201d\n\nThe long friendship between Trump and Epstein saw them party at Mar-a-Lago, including in February 2000 when they posed with their then-girlfriends, Melania Knauss and Ghislaine Maxwell. Melania became First Lady; Maxwell is serving 20 years in federal prison. Davidoff Studios\/Getty Images\n\nEpstein has not previously been identified by Wolff as a source of his for Fire and Fury, the 2018 book on the Trump presidency, which is estimated to have made him more than $13m.\n\nWolff followed the book with two more\u2014Siege: Trump under Fire (2019) and Landslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency (2021)\u2014which proved less successful. The Daily Mail recently signed him up to cover Trump as a columnist, and he launched his podcast in June.\n\nTrump and Epstein were filmed laughing together in a clip captured at Mar-a-Lago in 1992 by NBC. They were also photographed smiling beside each other at Trump\u2019s Palm Beach estate in 1997 and 2000.\n\n\u201cHere are these two guys both driven by a need to do anything they wanted with women: dominance and submission and entertainment,\u201d Wolff says of the duo on his podcast. \u201cAnd one of them ends up in the darkest prison in the country and the other in the White House.\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign source claimed to the Beast that is it \u201cwidely known\u201d that Trump severed ties with Epstein after allegations of sex trafficking were levied against his once-close friend.",

Our missile capabilities are clear to everyone and everyone believes in them, and we have proven that during our operations.\u201d\n\nKamal Kharrazi mourning the death of former Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash in May - VAHID SALEMI\n\nIntelligence officials have suggested Iran could attack within days, possibly through a drone attack launched from one of its proxy groups in Iraq.\n\nIt is unclear whether Iran plans to attack Israel before or after next week\u2019s US election but Mr Kharrazi claimed Israel was to blame for increasing instability in the region.\n\nTehran was left reeling after Israel used dozens of aircraft, including F35 stealth jets, refuellers and drones, in a retaliatory attack in the early hours of last Saturday morning.\n\nIsrael was responding after the Islamic Republic launched 180 missiles towards Tel Aviv and Jerusalem earlier in October.\n\nThe Israeli military avoided directly targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in last weekend\u2019s strikes, although it hit a base linked to nuclear experiments.\n\nIran does not currently possess a nuclear weapon and there has so far been no indication that Tehran has decided to weaponise the programme.\n\nHowever, experts believe that it could produce sufficient weapons-grade enriched uranium for a weapon in a week.\n\nDeveloping the weapon would take months and mounting it on a warhead capable of reaching Israel or another enemy could take even longer.\n\nKharrazi said that although Iran has the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons, it is currently held back by a fatwa, or religious decree, issued in the early 2000s by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nHe added this could change if the country\u2019s existence was under threat.\n\n\u201cIf Iran faces an existential threat, it will change its nuclear doctrine. We now have the necessary ability to produce nuclear weapons, and the only obstacle is the fatwa of the Leader, which has banned the production of nukes,\u201d Kharrazi said.\n\nIran\u2019s military General, Mohammad Bagheri (L) and Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, face off against Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu in Tehran - SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nHe also said that the Islamic Republic of Iran would increase cooperation with Russia, which it has been supplying with drones and missiles.\n\n\u201cRussia and China seek to build a new international system in order to be free from the West\u2019s hegemony and authority,\u201d he said.\n\nKharrazi added that it will increase the range of its missiles beyond a self-imposed limit of 1,250 miles if Europe ignores \u201cIran\u2019s territorial integrity\u201d.\n\nWhile Israel did not attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, last weekend\u2019s strikes make it easier to do so, having severely damaged the country\u2019s air defences.\n\nIran\u2019s nuclear site in Isfahan in April 4, 2024 - AP\n\nAll four of Iran\u2019s Russian-made S-300 air-defence systems have now been taken out, meaning it is easier for Israeli fighter jets to safely enter Iranian airspace.\n\nChris Biggers, an imagery expert who used to work for America\u2019s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, told the Economist that satellite images show evidence of a destroyed radar to the south-west of Tehran and another system on the western border.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s strike only F-35 stealth fighters entered Iranian airspace while F-15 and F-16 jets fired long range missiles from neighbouring Iraq.\n\nTo strike nuclear sites buried deep underground missiles would have to be fired closer to the target but the destruction of air defence systems and radars could make this easier.",

        "full_text":"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nJoe\u2019s Gotta\u2019 Go.\n\nTalk with just about any professional Democrat in Washington or with a state party or even in a local race for utility commission, and that\u2019s the overwhelming and increasingly contemptuous verdict when it comes to President Joe Biden in the final days of a tighter-than-it-should be race for the White House. A long-known gaffe factory who has repeatedly upended the best-laid plans with a verbal outburst, Biden had largely been relegated to campaign emeritus status as his Vice President took up the nomination in July and has done her level best to stay loyal to her boss. But with Biden\u2019s latest\u2014he sounded like he was calling Trump supporters \u201cgarbage\u201d\u2014it\u2019s increasingly clear that the instinct to humor the President is coming at a cost.\n\nIn fact, the ghosting of Biden may have to become a stiff-arm from Harris herself in these final days if her bid to block Trump is to have even odds. It will be awkward, for Harris and her staff alike, but Biden\u2019s feelings cannot supersede the political needs for Democrats at this fragile moment. The stakes are too high, and Biden too unpredictable and desperate to prove he is more than a placeholder in a gilded storage locker. In fact, Biden has the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in his presidency since George H.W. Bush was coasting toward defeat in 1992. His latest slip-up only further digs the hole he finds himself in.\n\n\u201cGarbage\u201d was not a word many of us had on our campaign BINGO cards, but twice in the final 10 days it has emerged as a potential race-changing utterance. First, a comedian who spoke at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally included in his lewd and racist routine an observation that Puerto Rico was a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d Trump tried to pass the comments on Sunday off as something he had no knowledge of, even though his aides had vetted the routine. The political damage was done.\n\nBut then, two days later and about a half-hour before Harris was set to deliver a masterful closing argument with the White House\u2019s south front as her backdrop, Biden was trying to buck up Latino supporters in a call from the White House residence. (Campaign events cannot take place in the West Wing, which guaranteed Biden would not be in the Oval Office while Harris spoke. Eagle-eyed watchers of Harris\u2019 address absorbed some symbolism in the darkened Oval Office behind her: a Harris administration would be a new thing, not a continuation of the current one.) As Biden spoke up his Vice President and talked down his predecessor, he touched on the uproar over Trump\u2019s comic. What was meant as a comment denouncing the comic\u2019s rhetoric toward Puerto Rico instead turned into a flub that seemed to know no limits. Biden sounded as if he was calling Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cgarbage,\u201d although a crisis-mode White House distributed a transcript that suggested that the President was calling the rhetoric garbage, not the supporters who cheered it.\n\nTo wit, this is how the White House transcribed the comment: \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter\u2019s\u2014his\u2014his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d Trump allies, summoning every bit of performative outrage, claim that the White House clean-up is meant to mask that what Biden actually said was \u201chis supporters\u201d\u2014no apostrophe. It\u2019s impossible to say what Biden exactly meant in the moment although given his half-century of public life, it was probably more a stutter and stammer than slander.\n\nEven so, that\u2019s not a place where Harris wanted to be. A day after an uplifting and unifying speech just off the White House grounds and before an epic crowd, Harris risked her pledge to work for all Americans and be the antithesis of Trump seeming hollow. And her campaign team knew it. On Wednesday, she told reporters traveling with her from Andrews Air Force Base that Biden had \u201cclarified\u201d his comment, but distanced herself from her boss more strongly than ever before: \u201cLet me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\u201d\n\nIt did little to quiet the chaos, with Trump donning a sanitary worker\u2019s vest and riding in a garbage truck at a campaign stop in Wisconsin later that day. In a way, Biden\u2019s attempt to help actually muted the real \u201cgarbage\u201d remark and injected a late-breaking messaging misstep that should have never come up.\n\nDemocrats have long tolerated Biden\u2019s total lack of verbal discipline. As a Senator, he was a guaranteed gaffe-a-day on the Hill, often contradicting party Leadership, preempting his colleagues\u2019 long-laid plans, and sabotaging his fellow Democrats in the White House. His first bid for the White House ended in a plagiarism scandal, his second began with comments that came off as disparaging Barack Obama, who would later pick Biden as his steady-handed global ambassador. As Vice President, Biden was a string of unforced errors, most notably at a bill signing for the law now known as Obamacare where he was caught on a hot-mic deploying vulgar language.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies have tried with varying degrees of success to make such unscripted moments part of the Biden brand, an authenticity that is often lacking. The spin made him into a laughable Uncle Joe, a cartoon who likes aviator sunglasses and ice cream. But the front lasted only so long, and a disastrous debate against Trump in June set in motion weeks of recrimination about 81-year-old Biden\u2019s ability to win, let alone serve another four years. Eventually, Biden recognized the realities, endorsed Harris as his heir, and nursed his wounded ego. Biden\u2019s loose tongue eventually proved his undoing.\n\nBut Biden still has the top job in geopolitics, and nominally still is the head of the Democratic Party. He delivered the biggest investment in green tech in U.S. history, helped dig the global economy out of a recession, and passed the infrastructure bill Trump never could. The problem is this: no one has the heart to tell him his presidency is coasting in lame-duck status with every passing week, especially with an absentee Congress looking at its own re-election bids. By the time the Democrats assembled in Chicago to officially nominate Harris, Biden\u2019s presence was the awkward relative who had to be invited to the wedding but no one wanted to sit next to. His 52-minute speech seemed never-ending as delegates shifted between respectful and restless. \u201cIt was sad to watch him. He didn\u2019t realize how everyone else had already turned the page,\u201d says a former Biden aide who was there. \u201cNo one had the courage or the heart to tell him that the crowd was not there for him.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Biden has been itching to get out on the road, his orbit says. He still thinks he alone has the decoder for white, working-class voters who have been tepid on Democrats and even more lukewarm on Harris, who would make history as the first woman and second person of color elected to the presidency. Biden keeps asking his staffers to check with the Harris campaign\u2014which took over Biden\u2019s own offices in Wilmington as a matter of efficient take-over\u2014about where he could be helpful.\n\nAnd with respectful consistency, Wilmington has been telling the White House a steady message: We\u2019ll let you know. It\u2019s an especially awkward brush-off, especially since so many members of the Harris high command were initially hired as Biden\u2019s operatives. Middle-Class Joe is going to have to stay Second-String Joe in this final inning, no matter how steamed both camps are at the moment.\n\nBiden\u2019s braintrust insists they get it, even if their longtime boss is slower to see it. They see a friend a few steps off his best game, and at its peak was never flawless. His \u201cgarbage\u201d gaffe was only the latest such blunder. During a visit to New Hampshire last week, saying of Trump, \u201cWe got to lock him up,\u201d before quickly adding, \u201cPolitically lock him up. Lock him out.\u201d It was catnip for conservatives who believe Trump\u2019s claims that Biden weaponized the justice system against him.\n\nThen, on Friday, Biden seemed to suggest former Rep. Gabby Giffords was dead. She is not, having survived an assassination attempt and still running the vanguard anti-gun violence group in the country that bears her name.\n\nIf any of these missteps were stand-alone events, it would be reasonable to chalk them up as a tired man showing his age. But it\u2019s been like this for a long while, even if Biden hasn\u2019t accepted it. Biden thinks the elites and the press are hyper-focused on his gaffes, and let those made by Trump and others slide. To the ever-thin-skinned Biden, he\u2019s getting bullied again despite his good intentions.\n\nSo, heading into the final weekend before Election Day, a sidelined and chastened President is going to have to ride the bench and let Harris land the massive machine she inherited from him. For his part, Biden plans a trip Friday to visit with union members in Philadelphia, something of a second homebase for the Bidens across the river from Delaware. That event, however, is tellingly an official White House function, not a Harris campaign rally. Biden just doesn\u2019t seem to understand a maxim of all performative endeavors, including politics: the greatest know when to cede the stage.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

        "full_text":"With the general election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump upon us, endorsements from high-profile figures hold much significance. Especially those that involve crossing party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former Governor of California, spoke out on Wednesday, Oct. 30, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), endorsing Harris over Trump. He joins a growing number of Republicans who have decided to vote Democrat this November.\n\nHere is a list of the prominent Republicans crossing party lines and voting for Harris over Trump in the 2024 election:\n\nFormer Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nActor and former Governor of California Schwarzenegger endorsed Democratic nominee Harris for President over his fellow Republican, Trump, in a lengthy social media post. Schwarzenegger said he does not typically give endorsements, as he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust most politicians,\u201d but he understands why people want to know his opinions since he is \u201cnot just a celebrity,\u201d but also a former Governor.\n\n\u201cTo someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a [sic] trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That\u2019s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney\n\nOn Sept. 6, Former Vice President and influential Republican Dick Cheney released a statement announcing his endorsement of Harris for President. Speaking out against the Republican nominee, Cheney said that Trump can \u201cnever be trusted with power again.\u201d\n\nCheney, who served as Vice President under President George W. Bush between 2001 and 2009, went on to say that American citizens have a \u201cduty\u201d to prioritize the nation over partisan politics.\n\n\u201cIn our nation\u2019s 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\u201d Cheney said in his statement. \u201cHe tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,\u201d he continued, referencing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nFormer Representative Liz Cheney\n\nDick Cheney\u2019s endorsement came a week after his daughter, former Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney said that she\u2019d vote for Harris.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative and someone who believes in and cares deeply about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses\u2014not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\u201d Cheney said on Sept. 4 at a Sanford School of Public Policy event at Duke University in North Carolina.\n\nCheney served as vice-chair of the Jan. 6 committee and was one of two Republicans on the panel\u2014something that Trump called to have her jailed for.\n\nFormer Representative Adam Kinzinger\n\nFormer Illinois Rep. and Republican Adam Kinzinger became a staunch critic of Trump after the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and spoke about endorsing Harris on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago in August. He encouraged other Republicans who wish to \u201cdefend democracy and decency\u201d to do the same.\n\n\u201cI was a Republican for 12 years in Congress, and I still hold on to the label,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and democracy, and she is dedicated to upholding all three in service to our country.\u201d\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the businessman who served as White House Director of Communications under Trump for 10 days in 2017, endorsed Harris, and has even said he is working alongside Harris on her campaign\u2019s crypto policies.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is capable and has a great team,\u201d he said in July, via a social media post.\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan spoke at the DNC, arguing that he stands in front of the crowd \u201cas an American\u201d though he is a Republican too. He focused his speech on other Republicans who may be watching, saying that the \u201cparty is not civil or conservative. It\u2019s chaotic and crazy.\u201d Duncan referred to Trump as a \u201cdirect threat to democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back towards policy, empathy, and tone, you know the right thing to do. Now let\u2019s have the courage to do it in November,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Senator Jeff Flake\n\nRepublican former Senator and Arizona representative Jeff Flake posted a statement to X on Sept. 29, announcing his support of the Harriz-Walz ticket, though he still calls himself a \u201cconservative Republican.\u201d He noted that he served with both Harris and Walz in Congress and that he knows \u201cfirst hand\u201d how much they love America.\n\n\u201cI want to support a Presidential candidate who seeks to unite our country rather than one who divides us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn times like these, there is nothing more conservative than putting country over party.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll be supporting @KamalaHarris for President and @Tim_Walz for Vice President. My full statement below. pic.twitter.com\/6b28mkBPMD \u2014 Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) September 29, 2024\n\n200 former Bush, McCain, and Romney staffers\n\nMore than 200 Republicans who worked for both Bush Presidents, the late Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Mitt Romney released an open letter in August, declaring endorsement of Harris.\n\nIn their letter, which was first reported by USA Today, the former staff members wrote that they were reiterating the 2020 decision by George W. Bush, McCain, and Romney alumni to \u201cwarn\u201d against re-electing Trump. Now, they are \u201creuniting\u201d to endorse Harris in 2024.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That\u2019s to be expected,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe alternative, however, is simply untenable.\u201d\n\nAlberto Gonzales\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales endorsed Harris in an opinion piece published by Politico on Sept. 12.\n\n\u201cAs the United States approaches a critical election, I can\u2019t sit quietly as Donald Trump\u2014perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation\u2014eyes a return to the White House,\u201d he wrote, pointing specifically to the events of Jan. 6. \u201cFor that reason, though I\u2019m a Republican, I\u2019ve decided to support Kamala Harris for President.\u201d\n\nFormer Congressman Denver Riggleman\n\nFormer Representative Denver Riggleman, who represented Virginia as a Republican, has endorsed Harris. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Aug. 9, Riggleman said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on is I think truth and facts need to be the baseline for this election. You can\u2019t have an inveterate liar as President of the United States\u2026 It\u2019s not about policy but the real reasons why Republicans should have the permission structure to vote for the Democratic ticket.\u201d\n\nFormer Representative Fred Upton\n\nFormer Michigan Republican Congressman Fred Upton, who served for three decades in the House of Representatives, endorsed Harris on Oct. 24\n\n\u201cWatching Trump day after day, he's ignored the advice of many senior, respected Republicans to stay on the issues,\u201d Upton told The Detroit News. \u201cInstead, he's still talking about the election being stolen, trashing women left and right. He's just totally unhinged. We don't need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that's why I'm where I am.\u201d\n\nUpton retired in 2022 after voting to impeach Trump the year before.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Attorney General Tom Rath\n\nFormer New Hampshire Attorney General, Republican Tom Rath spoke to a local news station during the final week of October, stating that this is an \u201cextraordinary moment in our history,\u201d and explaining his endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I think this is an election that completely oversteps any partisan identification,\" Rath said. \"This is not a Republican vote or a Democratic vote. This is a vote that speaks to what we want ourselves to be and what we want our government to be.\"\n\nFormer New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey\n\nFormer New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey also shared strong words against Trump.\n\n\u201cHe's dangerous to our safety, dangerous to peace, dangerous to democracy and freedom,\u201d Humphrey, who served two terms in the Senate from 1979-1990, said in the same local news interview with Rath. \u201cI voted for Republicans for more than 50 years. I can't vote for Trump, as a father, as a grandfather, as a veteran, as a former U.S. Senator.\u201d\n\nStephanie Grisham\n\nFormer Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who also served as Melania Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff, appeared at the DNC, where she shared that Harris \u201chas [her] vote.\u201d\n\nAt the convention, Grisham\u2014who resigned after Jan 6.\u2014took to the stage and said she felt \u201cvery strongly\u201d about speaking out.\n\n\u201cI love my country more than my party,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cKamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote.\u201d\n\nJimmy McCain\n\nJimmy McCain, son of former Arizona Senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, endorsed Harris in September, also stating that he had changed his voter registration to Democrat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll bring everyone together. She'll bring that moderation, that bipartisanship that we've been missing for so long,\u201d McCain told 12 News on Sept. 8, sharing that the Trump campaign\u2019s conduct at Arlington National Cemetery was what instigated his Harris endorsement.\n\nSenator Robert Cowles\n\nState Senator for Wisconsin\u2019s 2nd District, Republican Robert Cowles called Trump a \u201ctotalitarian\u201d in an interview with Rational Revolution on Oct. 24, and stated he would be voting for Harris.\n\nCowles said he is \u201cready\u201d for the blowback of publicly announcing his decision. \u201cWe have to make a change here and Trump has to be defeated and we have to protect the Constitution and the country will go on, even with some liberal things that Harris might do,\u201d he said.\n\nMayor John Giles\n\nJohn Giles, Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, shared his endorsement of Harris in an opinion piece for the Arizona Republic in July. Giles has been Mayor of the third largest city in Arizona, a notable swing state in the upcoming election, since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party with Trump at its helm continues down the path of political extremism, away from focusing on our fundamental freedoms,\u201d Giles wrote in the op-ed. He went on to argue that Trump did not support Arizona cities and that Harris is the \u201ccompetent, just, and fair leader\u201d that the country \u201cdeserves\u201d",

        "full_text":"If Donald Trump reclaims the White House, he will have one voting demographic to thank for it: men. That\u2019s the fundamental theory of the Trump campaign. In the election\u2019s final weeks, the former President and his political operation have sought to activate low-to-mid propensity male voters, particularly young ones, with surgical precision to sweep him back into power.\n\nThat\u2019s meant eschewing traditional media interviews in favor of fawning long-form podcast conversations with laddish hosts who draw massive young male audiences, such as Theo Von, Lex Friedman, Logan Paul, the Nelk Boys, and Joe Rogan, who boasts the most popular podcast in America. Instead of trotting out endorsements from political heavy-hitters, they have touted support from professional athletes such as the retired Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre, former Pittsburgh Steelers Antonio Brown and Le\u2019Veon Bell, and the boxer Jake Paul. At the Palm Beach headquarters, the campaign has built a data mine to target irregular GOP male voters and unregistered young men in swing states who they surmise can tip the scales in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nTop Trump officials tell TIME the strategy is based on a glaring reality: Most regular voters have deeply entrenched views of Donald Trump. But for the last two years, internal surveys and focus groups have found that a cohort of men under the age of 40 are the most moveable in his direction, especially those less politically engaged and who consume news and information from non-traditional sources. \u201cThese people we want to mobilize, where there's really a high return on investment for us, are not super-political folks,\u201d says a Trump aide. \u201cWe are not doing super-political media. You see us talking to younger and more male audiences. It\u2019s data driven.\u201d\n\nThe analysis is also informed by historical trendlines. In 2020, President Joe Biden did just as well with women as Hillary Clinton did four years earlier\u2014winning them over by a 13-point margin\u2014but narrowed Trump\u2019s lead with men. Trump beat Biden with men by six points whereas he routed Clinton with them by 11 points, according to a post-election analysis by the political data firm Catalist. \u201cWhere we lost ground on raw vote terms primarily was men,\u201d says a Trump official. To that end, the campaign has devised a straightforward thesis of the race: \u201cMax out the men and hold the women.\u201d\n\nThat won\u2019t be easy. The American political landscape shifted dramatically after the Supreme Court, emboldened by three of Trump\u2019s conservative appointments, ended a constitutional right to an abortion. Following the Dobbs decision in 2022, Republicans have underperformed in races across the country. In the first presidential election since the high court\u2019s ruling, women appear more motivated than ever, and polling shows that they prefer Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by 12 points, according to a New York Times\/Siena poll.\n\nGiven that environment, Trump advisers aren\u2019t under any illusions. They know the former President will lose with women voters but say their aim is to preserve the same support they had with that group in the last two elections. That\u2019s why they've tried to keep the focus as much as they can on the economy, immigration, and crime\u2014themes they say resonate with suburban women in particular. \u201cHold them steady,\u2019 says the Trump aide. \u201cDon't lose ground.\u201d\n\nBut there are signs the force of female voters could foil Trump\u2019s ascension. A POLITICO analysis found that women account for roughly 55% of the early vote across several battleground states, whereas men account for 45%. That gender gap is apparent so far in Pennsylvania\u2019s early voting, according to the University of Florida\u2019s United States Election Project. With its 19 electoral votes, the commonwealth is considered a must-win for both candidates. For that reason, a web of Trump-allied groups are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into voter registration and mobilization drives there. The effort has been turbocharged in recent weeks by the billionaire Elon Musk, who donated $118 million to boost Trump\u2019s chances in the crucial swing state.\n\nSimilar operations are underway in the rest of the battleground states, where outside groups have set up field organizations to target likely Trump voters. Thanks to a Federal Elections Commission ruling in March, Trump\u2019s team has been allowed to maintain some communication with PACs and nonprofits. Trump officials say that has enabled the campaign and the constellation of groups to remain tactically aligned.\n\nIn some swing states, the arrangement is showing signs of success. In Arizona, where the Trump campaign\u2019s voter registration and turnout drive was largely outsourced to the hard-right group Turning Point USA, Republican males are the highest early voting demographic among new voters. The organization, led by the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk, created its \u201cChase the Vote\u201d initiative after Republicans suffered devastating losses in the 2022 midterms, when Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake fell short by roughly 17,000 votes. Trump lost the state by roughly 10,000 votes two years earlier.\n\nTurning Point says it created a \u201ccommunity-organizing model\u201d designed to mobilize both the MAGA faithful and irregular conservative voters to cast ballots early, either by mail or in person. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on highly-likely Republicans who are low-propensity voters,\u201d says Tyler Bowyer, Turning Point\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cPeople who don't always vote but are with us ideologically.\u201d The group says it has hired thousands of paid staffers to register voters and provide a \u201cconcierge service\u201d to help them return their mail ballots. It has also set up similar operations in Wisconsin and Republican rich congressional districts in Nevada and Michigan.\n\nIf the race is as close as polling suggests, the election could be won or lost at the margins. In the Trump campaign\u2019s view, their fate ultimately boils down to young men who have been disengaged from politics but who could deliver Trump a victory. It\u2019s a risky bet. They are relying on the historically least reliable cohort of the electorate. But it\u2019s the core of the former President\u2019s unconventional campaign strategy. \u201cWe start with what the data tells us our highest opportunities are, then we pursue that,\u201d says the Trump official. \u201cSometimes that runs up against what the outside world expects.\u201d",

        "full_text":"TikTok has emerged as an essential part of the 2024 campaign media landscape, with nearly 40% of adults under 30 regularly consuming news on the platform, according to a Pew study.\n\nWith Meta announcing earlier this year that it would no longer prioritize political content, TikTok became a key tool for reaching young voters, despite the controversy about banning it in the U.S. \u201cTikTok is really the only social media platform where campaigns or political groups can have their content served to people that don't already follow them,\u201d says Kyle Tharp, author of the FWIW newsletter, which tracks digital politics.\n\nThat both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have embraced non-traditional media like TikTok and podcasts in their 2024 campaigns points to a shift in where and how voters are engaging with politics, Tharp argues. \u201cIncreasingly, those types of persuadable voters that [candidates] need to reach are not consuming news and information on mainstream platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cThey're not watching CNN, they're not reading the New York Times, and instead, a lot of them are getting their news about the election from social media platforms.\u201d\n\nTIME spoke to Tharp on Oct. 31 to get his insights on the top five campaign moments that went viral on TikTok. He says in 2024, the biggest breakout moments for TikTok users ranged from researched explainers of Project 2025 to a remixed song made from a Trump debate quote about immigrants \u201ceating the pets.\u201d\n\nHarris becoming the nominee\n\nWhen Harris became the Democratic nominee at the end of July after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, she received a swell of support online. \u201cIt just unleashed a complete vibe shift on the platform,\u201d says Tharp.\n\nWhen Biden ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris on July 21, the campaign\u2019s TikTok following doubled overnight, after rebranding from @BidenHQ to @KamalaHQ. Users embraced meme culture, clipping a May 2023 quote from Harris, in which she recalled her mother asking, \u201cDo you think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d and making TikTok edits in the neon green signature color of singer Charli XCX\u2019s \u201cBrat Summer\u201d trend.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of reporting earlier this spring where it showed consistently there's a lot of negative sentiment towards Joe Biden and a lot of positive sentiment towards Donald Trump,\u201d says Tharp. \u201cAnd after Kamala Harris became the nominee, that really shifted, and the majority of posts mentioning Harris were positive, and a majority of folks mentioning Trump were negative. And that has really stayed static throughout the entire election cycle.\u201d\n\nHarris-Trump presidential debate\n\nThe September 10 presidential debate between Harris and Trump was another big moment on the platform. \u201cMillions and millions of people watched the debate on traditional television, but tens of millions of people were watching the debate on TikTok,\u201d Tharp says. \u201cMaybe they don't really care to sit down and watch a 90-minute TV segment, but they will be scrolling through their feeds to see the top clips or what people are saying about the debate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s false claim about immigrants in Ohio \u201ceating the dogs\u201d became a trending audio, while videos of Harris\u2019s reactions to some of Trump\u2019s comments \u201ctook off like wildfire\u201d on the platform, Tharp says.\n\nProject 2025\n\nContent explaining Project 2025, an initiative from the conservative Heritage Foundation that lays out policy recommendations for the next Republican President, made waves on TikTok earlier this year. The content primarily took the form of explainers, breaking down the impact of proposed policies. (Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025.)\n\n\u201cFrom April to June, we really saw tons and tons of individual creators, not just the campaigns, but individual creators talking about Project 2025, on TikTok,\u201d says Tharp.\n\nTrump\u2019s McDonald\u2019s stunt\n\nFootage of Trump serving fries at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania on Oct. 20 has done big numbers on the platform. \u201cTrump's stunt at McDonald's\u2026 really paid off for his campaign on TikTok. It generated like over 200 million views on pieces of content about it, which was really wild and unexpected,\u201d Tharp says.\n\n\u201cA lot of Americans view Trump as a reality TV star that does cartoonish weird things,\u201d Tharp adds, \u201cand that type of behavior really captivates audiences.\u201d\n\nCelebrity and creator endorsements\n\nCelebrity and creator endorsements throughout the past 100 days have captured a lot of engagement, Tharp says. The Harris campaign has found success posting videos featuring Barack and Michelle Obama, and celebrities such as Usher, while the Trump campaign has seen success tapping influencers like Jake and Logan Paul and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cMost people go to TikTok for non-political content, and so when you're able to show celebrities and non-political folks in your content, it probably pops off a lot more,\u201d Tharp says.",

The vehicle did not have a front license plate, but it did have a rear plate with unknown letters or numbers.\n\nThe incendiary devices were marked with the message \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nA third device placed at a different drop box in Vancouver earlier this month also carried the words \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in addition to \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d the official said.\n\nInvestigators are trying to identify the person responsible and the motive for the suspected arson attacks, which destroyed or damaged hundreds of ballots at the drop box in Vancouver on Monday when the box\u2019s fire suppression system didn\u2019t work as intended. Authorities are trying to figure out whether the suspect actually had pro-Palestinian views or used the message to try to create confusion, the official said.\n\nRead More: Your Vote Is Safe\n\nSurveillance images captured a Volvo pulling up to a drop box in Portland just before security personnel nearby discovered a fire inside the box on Monday, Benner said. The early-morning fire was extinguished quickly thanks to the box\u2019s suppression system and a nearby security guard, police said. Just three of the ballots inside were damaged.\n\nThe ballot box in Vancouver that burned also had a fire suppression system inside, but it failed to prevent hundreds of ballots from being scorched, said Greg Kimsey, the longtime elected auditor in Clark County, Washington, which includes Vancouver.\n\nElections staff were able to identify 488 damaged ballots retrieved from the box, and as of Tuesday evening, 345 of those voters had contacted the county auditor\u2019s office to request a replacement ballot, the office said in a statement Wednesday. The office will mail 143 ballots to the rest of the identified voters on Thursday.\n\nSix of the ballots were unidentifiable, and the office said the exact number of destroyed ballots wasn\u2019t known, as some may have completely burned to ash.\n\nElection staff on Wednesday planned to sort through the damaged ballots for information about who cast them, in the hopes that those voters can be given replacement ballots. Kimsey urged voters who dropped their ballots in the transit center box between 11 a.m. Saturday and early Monday to contact his office for a replacement ballot.\n\nAuthorities in Portland said Monday that enough material from the incendiary devices was recovered to show that the two fires were connected\u2014and that they were connected to an Oct. 8 incendiary device at a different ballot drop box in Vancouver. No ballots were damaged in that incident.\n\nVoters in Washington are encouraged to check the status of their ballots at www.votewa.gov to track their return status. If a returned ballot is not marked as \u201creceived,\u201d voters can print a replacement ballot or visit their local elections department for a replacement, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.\n\n\u2014Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

        "full_text":"Former First Lady Melania Trump has been conspicuously absent on the campaign trail during her husband\u2019s 2024 presidential election bid. Yet in a recent interview to promote her forthcoming memoir, Melania, Trump made a bombshell revelation on one of the most divisive issues of this election: abortion. \u201cWhy should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does to her own body?\u201d asked the former First Lady.\n\nNot since the 1970s has the wife of the Republican presidential candidate taken such a clear pro-abortion-rights position during a campaign. This stands in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s silence on the issue throughout her tenure as First Lady. Likewise, it distinguishes her from a long line of GOP First Ladies who have quietly disagreed with their husbands over abortion, hoping to avoid jeopardizing the party\u2019s support from the religious right.\n\nWhy has the otherwise silent Trump decided to speak out on this issue now? The state of the GOP may well have driven her to do so. We know this from the 1970s, the last time a Republican First Lady\u2014Betty Ford\u2014spoke out openly in support of women\u2019s rights. Both then and now, the Republican party was undergoing an ideological reconfiguration, one which widened the gender gap. That opened up space for the First Lady to speak out on abortion without fear of damaging her husband\u2019s chances in November. Trump's comments therefore tell us as much about the state of the GOP as they do about abortion.\n\nBy the 1970s, the battle for the soul of the Republican Party was decades old. Conservatives had spent years building a movement to oppose the dominant brand of moderate Republicanism most associated with President Dwight Eisenhower and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Throughout the 1960s, rising conservatives, most especially Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, challenged the party\u2019s orthodoxy.\n\nWith the collapse of the Nixon Administration after Watergate and the decision by new President Gerald Ford to pardon his predecessor, the Republican Party found itself in crisis. Ford had to contend with leading Southern and Western Republicans pushing the party rightward as he attempted to navigate a way out of the national spiritual nadir. Women within the party were also engaged in a fierce battle, with conservative activists like Phylis Schlafly rising to the fore and demanding the party shed its historic support for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), legal abortion, and other feminist aims \u2014 and instead become the party of traditional conservative family values. The new First Lady, Betty Ford, was squarely on the opposite side of this debate.\n\nRead More: Melania Trump Shares Her Views on Abortion in New Interview\u2014and Donald's Reaction\n\nAs the GOP underwent this fundamental identity crisis, abortion emerged as a core issue dividing the party.\n\nIt was in this context in August 1975 that Betty Ford sat down with 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer. He observed that abortion was \u201ckind of a taboo subject for the wife of the President.\u201d Despite that, however, Safer wanted to know what Ford thought about the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which ruled that the Constitution protected a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion under some circumstances. Ford dismissed the idea that First Ladies shouldn't tackle the tough issue, instead remarking that she felt \u201cvery strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion.\u201d\n\nKnowing that the answer would infuriate the rising GOP right, the Ford Administration attempted to distinguish the First Lady\u2019s views from those of the President and the Republican Party by noting that this was her own personal opinion. President Ford admitted to reporters after the interview aired that he anticipated losing millions of votes as a result of his wife\u2019s comments, but he largely tried to remain neutral. The First Lady\u2019s comments prompted a swift backlash, with Mormon Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, for one, condemning the interview in a CBS broadcast as part of a wider \u201cdeterioration of morality around the world.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady, however, wasn\u2019t interested in ceding ground. She had a very different vision for the GOP. She wanted to see ratification of the ERA and protection for abortion rights. Mrs. Ford was not alone in this regard. She had the support of a cohort of Republican feminists including RNC co-chair Mary Dent Crisp.\n\nYet, the tectonic plates of the party were already shifting. Betty Ford\u2019s brand of bipartisan feminism was already becoming increasingly unfashionable. Republican feminists felt power slipping away as Ronald Reagan mounted a challenge for the Republican nomination in 1976. By 1980, when Reagan secured control of the GOP, Crisp was ousted from her position and ended up running John Anderson\u2019s independent presidential campaign.\n\nBetty Ford kept pushing for women\u2019s equality even after her husband lost in 1976, but her brand of moderate Republicanism waned as the 1970s progressed. Reagan\u2019s ascendency solidified the shift of the GOP to the right. Abortion remained front and center as a political issue\u2014not just a women\u2019s issue\u2014as the Reagan Revolution reshaped the American political landscape.\n\nIn 1980, for the first time in 40 years, the GOP dropped support of the ERA from its platform. The battle to ratify the Amendment fizzled out, even after Congress extended the deadline to 1982. As moderates left the party, Reagan courted the newly organized Christian Right and First Lady Nancy Reagan followed suit.\n\nThe new First Lady personally opposed abortion but quietly supported women\u2019s right to make the choice for themselves. Yet Mrs. Reagan refused to make this declaration in public, knowing that such a stance would enrage her husband\u2019s Evangelical supporters. In 1984, when a Los Angeles Times reporter asked her about exceptions to allow abortion in instances of rape, Nancy Reagan replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d This response forced her staff to clarify that the First Lady \u201chad no obligation to explain her position further, because she is not an elected official or a person seeking office.\u201d It was not until 1994\u2014years after her husband had left the White House\u2014that she made her personal opinions on the matter known.\n\nRead More: Roe v. Wade Lawyer 'Amazed' Americans Still Fighting Over Abortion\n\nReagan\u2019s successor, Barbara Bush, also obscured her pro-abortion-rights position during her husband\u2019s presidency. When pressed on the issue during his 1992 reelection campaign, she dodged, instead stating that abortion was a personal choice and that the issue should not be in the party platform \u201ceither pro or con.\u201d Her statement shocked activists on either side of the issue. Pro-abortion-rights activists denounced it as a deliberate play to prevent liberal voters from defecting from the GOP while conservatives attempted to play Mrs. Bush's stance down, wary that it would cost her husband votes from the right.\n\nBush\u2019s daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, did go on the record stating that she did not believe that the Roe decision should be overturned in an interview the day before her own husband\u2019s inauguration in 2001 but largely abstained from discussing abortion since \u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d All three women\u2019s husbands maintained staunch anti-abortion positions and pushed anti-abortion policies.\n\nThe silence of the three Republican First Ladies stemmed from the alliance of the GOP with the Christian Right, which left minimal space for them to support abortion access as loudly as Betty Ford had done. Additionally, with Roe protecting these rights, it may have been easier to justify not speaking out as loudly.\n\nMelania Trump similarly said nothing about abortion rights during her husband\u2019s presidency. But in 2022, the Supreme Court reshaped the debate over women's reproductive health by overturning Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health\u2014a direct result of appointments made by Trump's husband. The decision eliminated the constitutional right to have an abortion, and hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections. Donald Trump has worked to muddy his stance on the issue, even claiming he would veto a national abortion ban.\n\nThis changing GOP climate created a space for Melania Trump\u2019s voice to be heard on abortion. Just as the party underwent a period of demographic reconfiguration in the 1970s, the current GOP is at a pivotal moment where it is transforming from the Republican Party that existed from the 1980s to 2020s \u2014 a party of traditional conservatism and moral values \u2014 to the GOP of Donald Trump the individual.\n\nMelania speaking out may well be an attempt to sway undecided voters who are not social conservatives but remain unconvinced by the Democratic establishment and open to a potentially loosely ideologically defined Trumpism. It\u2019s also a bid to try and capture women\u2019s vote at a time when, after Dobbs, the gender gap is wider than ever. Her stance on abortion is a reminder to voters that not only are reproductive rights on the ballot in November, but so too is the future of the Republican Party itself.\n\nElizabeth Rees is a postdoctoral fellow at Southern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History in Dallas, Texas.
