sampson. ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt. gregory. they must take it in sense that feel it. sampson. me they shall feel while i am able to stand: and tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh. gregory. tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor john. draw thy tool; here comes of the house of montagues. enter abram and balthasar. sampson. my naked weapon is out: quarrel, i will back thee. gregory. how? turn thy back and run? sampson. fear me not. gregory. no, marry; i fear thee! sampson. let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. gregory. i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it as they list. sampson. nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it. abram. do you bite your thumb at us, sir? sampson. i do bite my thumb, sir. abram. do you bite your thumb at us, sir? sampson. is the law of our side if i say ay? gregory. no. sampson. no sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but i bite my thumb, sir. gregory. do you quarrel, sir? abram. quarrel, sir? no, sir. sampson. but if you do, sir, i am for you. i serve as good a man as you. abram. no better. sampson. well, sir. enter benvolio. gregory. say better; here comes one of my master s kinsmen. sampson. yes, better, sir. abram. you lie. sampson. draw, if you be men. gregory, remember thy washing blow. they fight. benvolio. part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do. beats down their swords. enter tybalt. tybalt. what, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? turn thee benvolio, look upon thy death. benvolio. i do but keep the peace, put up thy sword, or manage it to part these men with me. tybalt. what, drawn, and talk of peace? i hate the word as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee: have at thee, coward. they fight. enter three or four citizens with clubs. first citizen. clubs, bills and partisans! strike! beat them down! down with the capulets! down with the montagues! enter capulet in his gown, and lady capulet. capulet. what noise is this? give me my long sword, ho! lady capulet. a crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? capulet. my sword, i say! old montague is come, and flourishes his blade in spite of me. enter montague and his lady montague. montague. thou villain capulet! hold me not, let me go. lady montague. thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. enter prince escalus, with attendants. prince. rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, profaners of this neighbour-stained steel, will they not hear? what, ho! you men, you beasts, that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins, on pain of torture, from those bloody hands throw your mistemper d weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince. three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, by thee, old capulet, and montague, have thrice disturb d the quiet of our streets, and made verona s ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, to wield old partisans, in hands as old, canker d with peace, to part your canker d hate. if ever you disturb our streets again, your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. for this time all the rest depart away: you, capulet, shall go along with me, and montague, come you this afternoon, to know our farther pleasure in this case, to old free-town, our common judgement-place. once more, on pain of death, all men depart. exeunt prince and attendants; capulet, lady capulet, tybalt, citizens and servants. montague. who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? speak, nephew, were you by when it began? benvolio. here were the servants of your adversary and yours, close fighting ere i did approach. i drew to part them, in the instant came the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar d, which, as he breath d defiance to my ears, he swung about his head, and cut the winds, who nothing hurt withal, hiss d him in scorn. while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more, and fought on part and part, till the prince came, who parted either part. lady montague. o where is romeo, saw you him today? right glad i am he was not at this fray. benvolio. madam, an hour before the worshipp d sun peer d forth the golden window of the east, a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad, where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from this city side, so early walking did i see your son. towards him i made, but he was ware of me, and stole into the covert of the wood. i, measuring his affections by my own, which then most sought where most might not be found, being one too many by my weary self, pursu d my humour, not pursuing his, and gladly shunn d who gladly fled from me. montague. many a morning hath he there been seen, with tears augmenting the fresh morning s dew, adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; but all so soon as the all-cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora s bed, away from light steals home my heavy son, and private in his chamber pens himself, shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out and makes himself an artificial night. black and portentous must this humour prove, unless good counsel may the cause remove. benvolio. my noble uncle, do you know the cause? montague. i neither know it nor can learn of him. benvolio. have you importun d him by any means? montague. both by myself and many other friends; but he, his own affections counsellor, is to himself i will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close, so far from sounding and discovery, as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, or dedicate his beauty to the sun. could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, we would as willingly give cure as know. enter romeo. benvolio. see, where he comes. so please you step aside; i ll know his grievance or be much denied. montague. i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift. come, madam, let s away, exeunt montague and lady montague. benvolio. good morrow, cousin. romeo. is the day so young? benvolio. but new struck nine. romeo. ay me, sad hours seem long. was that my father that went hence so fast? benvolio. it was. what sadness lengthens romeo s hours? romeo. not having that which, having, makes them short. benvolio. in love? romeo. out. benvolio. of love? romeo. out of her favour where i am in love. benvolio. alas that love so gentle in his view, should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. romeo. alas that love, whose view is muffled still, should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here? yet tell me not, for i have heard it all. here s much to do with hate, but more with love: why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! o anything, of nothing first create! o heavy lightness! serious vanity! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! this love feel i, that feel no love in this. dost thou not laugh? benvolio. no coz, i rather weep. romeo. good heart, at what? benvolio. at thy good heart s oppression. romeo. why such is love s transgression. griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine. this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own. love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; being purg d, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes; being vex d, a sea nourish d with lovers tears: what is it else? a madness most discreet, a choking gall, and a preserving sweet. farewell, my coz. going. benvolio. soft! i will go along: and if you leave me so, you do me wrong. romeo. tut! i have lost myself; i am not here. this is not romeo, he s some other where. benvolio. tell me in sadness who is that you love? romeo. what, shall i groan and tell thee? benvolio. groan! why, no; but sadly tell me who. romeo. bid a sick man in sadness make his will, a word ill urg d to one that is so ill. in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman. benvolio. i aim d so near when i suppos d you lov d. romeo. a right good markman, and she s fair i love. benvolio. a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. romeo. well, in that hit you miss: she ll not be hit with cupid s arrow, she hath dian s wit; and in strong proof of chastity well arm d, from love s weak childish bow she lives uncharm d. she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes, nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: o she s rich in beauty, only poor that when she dies, with beauty dies her store. benvolio. then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? romeo. she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; for beauty starv d with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity. she is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, to merit bliss by making me despair. she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow do i live dead, that live to tell it now. benvolio. be rul d by me, forget to think of her. romeo. o teach me how i should forget to think. benvolio. by giving liberty unto thine eyes; examine other beauties. romeo. tis the way to call hers, exquisite, in question more. these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows, being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair; he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost. show me a mistress that is passing fair, what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass d that passing fair? farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget. benvolio. i ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. exeunt. scene ii. a street. enter capulet, paris and servant. capulet. but montague is bound as well as i, in penalty alike; and tis not hard, i think, for men so old as we to keep the peace. paris. of honourable reckoning are you both, and pity tis you liv d at odds so long. but now my lord, what say you to my suit? capulet. but saying o er what i have said before. my child is yet a stranger in the world, she hath not seen the change of fourteen years; let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. paris. younger than she are happy mothers made. capulet. and too soon marr d are those so early made. the earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she, she is the hopeful lady of my earth: but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart, my will to her consent is but a part; and she agree, within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice. this night i hold an old accustom d feast, whereto i have invited many a guest, such as i love, and you among the store, one more, most welcome, makes my number more. at my poor house look to behold this night earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well apparell d april on the heel of limping winter treads, even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house. hear all, all see, and like her most whose merit most shall be: which, on more view of many, mine, being one, may stand in number, though in reckoning none. come, go with me. go, sirrah, trudge about through fair verona; find those persons out whose names are written there, gives a paper and to them say, my house and welcome on their pleasure stay. exeunt capulet and paris. servant. find them out whose names are written here! it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ. i must to the learned. in good time! enter benvolio and romeo. benvolio. tut, man, one fire burns out another s burning, one pain is lessen d by another s anguish; turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; one desperate grief cures with another s languish: take thou some new infection to thy eye, and the rank poison of the old will die. romeo. your plantain leaf is excellent for that. benvolio. for what, i pray thee? romeo. for your broken shin. benvolio. why, romeo, art thou mad? romeo. not mad, but bound more than a madman is: shut up in prison, kept without my food, whipp d and tormented and god-den, good fellow. servant. god gi go-den. i pray, sir, can you read? romeo. ay, mine own fortune in my misery. servant. perhaps you have learned it without book. but i pray, can you read anything you see? romeo. ay, if i know the letters and the language. servant. ye say honestly, rest you merry! romeo. stay, fellow; i can read. he reads the letter. signior martino and his wife and daughters; county anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of utruvio; signior placentio and his lovely nieces; mercutio and his brother valentine; mine uncle capulet, his wife, and daughters; my fair niece rosaline and livia; signior valentio and his cousin tybalt; lucio and the lively helena. a fair assembly. gives back the paper whither should they come? servant. up. romeo. whither to supper? servant. to our house. romeo. whose house? servant. my master s. romeo. indeed i should have ask d you that before. servant. now i ll tell you without asking. my master is the great rich capulet, and if you be not of the house of montagues, i pray come and crush a cup of wine. rest you merry. exit. benvolio. at this same ancient feast of capulet s sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lov st; with all the admired beauties of verona. go thither and with unattainted eye, compare her face with some that i shall show, and i will make thee think thy swan a crow. romeo. when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire; and these who, often drown d, could never die, transparent heretics, be burnt for liars. one fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun ne er saw her match since first the world begun. benvolio. tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, herself pois d with herself in either eye: but in that crystal scales let there be weigh d your lady s love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast, and she shall scant show well that now shows best. romeo. i ll go along, no such sight to be shown, but to rejoice in splendour of my own. exeunt. scene iii. room in capulet s house. enter lady capulet and nurse. lady capulet. nurse, where s my daughter? call her forth to me. nurse. now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, i bade her come. what, lamb! what ladybird! god forbid! where s this girl? what, juliet! enter juliet. juliet. how now, who calls? nurse. your mother. juliet. madam, i am here. what is your will? lady capulet. this is the matter. nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret. nurse, come back again, i have remember d me, thou s hear our counsel. thou knowest my daughter s of a pretty age. nurse. faith, i can tell her age unto an hour. lady capulet. she s not fourteen. nurse. i ll lay fourteen of my teeth, and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four, she is not fourteen. how long is it now to lammas-tide? lady capulet. a fortnight and odd days. nurse. even or odd, of all days in the year, come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen. susan and she, god rest all christian souls! were of an age. well, susan is with god; she was too good for me. but as i said, on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen; that shall she, marry; i remember it well. tis since the earthquake now eleven years; and she was wean d, i never shall forget it , of all the days of the year, upon that day: for i had then laid wormwood to my dug, sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall; my lord and you were then at mantua: nay, i do bear a brain. but as i said, when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, to see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug! shake, quoth the dovehouse: twas no need, i trow, to bid me trudge. and since that time it is eleven years; for then she could stand alone; nay, by th rood she could have run and waddled all about; for even the day before she broke her brow, and then my husband, god be with his soul! a was a merry man, took up the child: yea, quoth he, dost thou fall upon thy face? thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; wilt thou not, jule? and, by my holidame, the pretty wretch left crying, and said ay . to see now how a jest shall come about. i warrant, and i should live a thousand years, i never should forget it. wilt thou not, jule? quoth he; and, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ay. lady capulet. enough of this; i pray thee hold thy peace. nurse. yes, madam, yet i cannot choose but laugh, to think it should leave crying, and say ay ; and yet i warrant it had upon it brow a bump as big as a young cockerel s stone; a perilous knock, and it cried bitterly. yea, quoth my husband, fall st upon thy face? thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; wilt thou not, jule? it stinted, and said ay . juliet. and stint thou too, i pray thee, nurse, say i. nurse. peace, i have done. god mark thee to his grace thou wast the prettiest babe that e er i nurs d: and i might live to see thee married once, i have my wish. lady capulet. marry, that marry is the very theme i came to talk of. tell me, daughter juliet, how stands your disposition to be married? juliet. it is an honour that i dream not of. nurse. an honour! were not i thine only nurse, i would say thou hadst suck d wisdom from thy teat. lady capulet. well, think of marriage now: younger than you, here in verona, ladies of esteem, are made already mothers. by my count i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid. thus, then, in brief; the valiant paris seeks you for his love. nurse. a man, young lady! lady, such a man as all the world why he s a man of wax. lady capulet. verona s summer hath not such a flower. nurse. nay, he s a flower, in faith a very flower. lady capulet. what say you, can you love the gentleman? this night you shall behold him at our feast; read o er the volume of young paris face, and find delight writ there with beauty s pen. examine every married lineament, and see how one another lends content; and what obscur d in this fair volume lies, find written in the margent of his eyes. this precious book of love, this unbound lover, to beautify him, only lacks a cover: the fish lives in the sea; and tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide. that book in many s eyes doth share the glory, that in gold clasps locks in the golden story; so shall you share all that he doth possess, by having him, making yourself no less. nurse. no less, nay bigger. women grow by men. lady capulet. speak briefly, can you like of paris love? juliet. i ll look to like, if looking liking move: but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly. enter a servant. servant. madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity. i must hence to wait, i beseech you follow straight. lady capulet. we follow thee. exit servant. juliet, the county stays. nurse. go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. exeunt. scene iv. a street. enter romeo, mercutio, benvolio, with five or six maskers; torch-bearers and others. romeo. what, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? or shall we on without apology? benvolio. the date is out of such prolixity: we ll have no cupid hoodwink d with a scarf, bearing a tartar s painted bow of lath, scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke after the prompter, for our entrance: but let them measure us by what they will, we ll measure them a measure, and be gone. romeo. give me a torch, i am not for this ambling; being but heavy i will bear the light. mercutio. nay, gentle romeo, we must have you dance. romeo. not i, believe me, you have dancing shoes, with nimble soles, i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move. mercutio. you are a lover, borrow cupid s wings, and soar with them above a common bound. romeo. i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers, and so bound, i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. under love s heavy burden do i sink. mercutio. and, to sink in it, should you burden love; too great oppression for a tender thing. romeo. is love a tender thing? it is too rough, too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn. mercutio. if love be rough with you, be rough with love; prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. give me a case to put my visage in: putting on a mask. a visor for a visor. what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities? here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me. benvolio. come, knock and enter; and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs. romeo. a torch for me: let wantons, light of heart, tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; for i am proverb d with a grandsire phrase, i ll be a candle-holder and look on, the game was ne er so fair, and i am done. mercutio. tut, dun s the mouse, the constable s own word: if thou art dun, we ll draw thee from the mire or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest up to the ears. come, we burn daylight, ho. romeo. nay, that s not so. mercutio. i mean sir, in delay we waste our lights in vain, light lights by day. take our good meaning, for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits. romeo. and we mean well in going to this mask; but tis no wit to go. mercutio. why, may one ask? romeo. i dreamt a dream tonight. mercutio. and so did i. romeo. well what was yours? mercutio. that dreamers often lie. romeo. in bed asleep, while they do dream things true. mercutio. o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you. she is the fairies midwife, and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman, drawn with a team of little atomies over men s noses as they lie asleep: her waggon-spokes made of long spinners legs; the cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; her traces, of the smallest spider s web; the collars, of the moonshine s watery beams; her whip of cricket s bone; the lash, of film; her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat, not half so big as a round little worm prick d from the lazy finger of a maid: her chariot is an empty hazelnut, made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, time out o mind the fairies coachmakers. and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains, and then they dream of love; o er courtiers knees, that dream on curtsies straight; o er lawyers fingers, who straight dream on fees; o er ladies lips, who straight on kisses dream, which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues, because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose, and then dreams he of smelling out a suit; and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig s tail, tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep, then dreams he of another benefice: sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, of breaches, ambuscados, spanish blades, of healths five fathom deep; and then anon drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; and, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, and sleeps again. this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night; and bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them, and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage: this is she, romeo. peace, peace, mercutio, peace, thou talk st of nothing. mercutio. true, i talk of dreams, which are the children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy, which is as thin of substance as the air, and more inconstant than the wind, who woos even now the frozen bosom of the north, and, being anger d, puffs away from thence, turning his side to the dew-dropping south. benvolio. this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves: supper is done, and we shall come too late. romeo. i fear too early: for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars, shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night s revels; and expire the term of a despised life, clos d in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death. but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my suit. on, lusty gentlemen! benvolio. strike, drum. exeunt. scene v. a hall in capulet s house. musicians waiting. enter servants. first servant. where s potpan, that he helps not to take away? he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher! second servant. when good manners shall lie all in one or two men s hands, and they unwash d too, tis a foul thing. first servant. away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate. good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me, let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell. antony and potpan! second servant. ay, boy, ready. first servant. you are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber. second servant. we cannot be here and there too. cheerly, boys. be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. exeunt. enter capulet, c. with the guests and gentlewomen to the maskers. capulet. welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes unplagu d with corns will have a bout with you. ah my mistresses, which of you all will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she i ll swear hath corns. am i come near ye now? welcome, gentlemen! i have seen the day that i have worn a visor, and could tell a whispering tale in a fair lady s ear, such as would please; tis gone, tis gone, tis gone, you are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. a hall, a hall, give room! and foot it, girls. music plays, and they dance. more light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, and quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. ah sirrah, this unlook d-for sport comes well. nay sit, nay sit, good cousin capulet, for you and i are past our dancing days; how long is t now since last yourself and i were in a mask? capulet s cousin. by r lady, thirty years. capulet. what, man, tis not so much, tis not so much: tis since the nuptial of lucentio, come pentecost as quickly as it will, some five and twenty years; and then we mask d. capulet s cousin. tis more, tis more, his son is elder, sir; his son is thirty. capulet. will you tell me that? his son was but a ward two years ago. romeo. what lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight? servant. i know not, sir. romeo. o, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop s ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o er her fellows shows. the measure done, i ll watch her place of stand, and touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! for i ne er saw true beauty till this night. tybalt. this by his voice, should be a montague. fetch me my rapier, boy. what, dares the slave come hither, cover d with an antic face, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? now by the stock and honour of my kin, to strike him dead i hold it not a sin. capulet. why how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? tybalt. uncle, this is a montague, our foe; a villain that is hither come in spite, to scorn at our solemnity this night. capulet. young romeo, is it? tybalt. tis he, that villain romeo. capulet. content thee, gentle coz, let him alone, a bears him like a portly gentleman; and, to say truth, verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well-govern d youth. i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement. therefore be patient, take no note of him, it is my will; the which if thou respect, show a fair presence and put off these frowns, an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. tybalt. it fits when such a villain is a guest: i ll not endure him. capulet. he shall be endur d. what, goodman boy! i say he shall, go to; am i the master here, or you? go to. you ll not endure him! god shall mend my soul, you ll make a mutiny among my guests! you will set cock-a-hoop, you ll be the man! tybalt. why, uncle, tis a shame. capulet. go to, go to! you are a saucy boy. is t so, indeed? this trick may chance to scathe you, i know what. you must contrary me! marry, tis time. well said, my hearts! you are a princox; go: be quiet, or more light, more light! for shame! i ll make you quiet. what, cheerly, my hearts. tybalt. patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. i will withdraw: but this intrusion shall, now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. exit. romeo. to juliet. if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this, my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. juliet. good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss. romeo. have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? juliet. ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. romeo. o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do: they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. juliet. saints do not move, though grant for prayers sake. romeo. then move not while my prayer s effect i take. thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg d. kissing her. juliet. then have my lips the sin that they have took. romeo. sin from my lips? o trespass sweetly urg d! give me my sin again. juliet. you kiss by the book. nurse. madam, your mother craves a word with you. romeo. what is her mother? nurse. marry, bachelor, her mother is the lady of the house, and a good lady, and a wise and virtuous. i nurs d her daughter that you talk d withal. i tell you, he that can lay hold of her shall have the chinks. romeo. is she a capulet? o dear account! my life is my foe s debt. benvolio. away, be gone; the sport is at the best. romeo. ay, so i fear; the more is my unrest. capulet. nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone, we have a trifling foolish banquet towards. is it e en so? why then, i thank you all; i thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. more torches here! come on then, let s to bed. ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late, i ll to my rest. exeunt all but juliet and nurse. juliet. come hither, nurse. what is yond gentleman? nurse. the son and heir of old tiberio. juliet. what s he that now is going out of door? nurse. marry, that i think be young petruchio. juliet. what s he that follows here, that would not dance? nurse. i know not. juliet. go ask his name. if he be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed. nurse. his name is romeo, and a montague, the only son of your great enemy. juliet. my only love sprung from my only hate! too early seen unknown, and known too late! prodigious birth of love it is to me, that i must love a loathed enemy. nurse. what s this? what s this? juliet. a rhyme i learn d even now of one i danc d withal. one calls within, juliet . nurse. anon, anon! come let s away, the strangers all are gone. exeunt. act ii enter chorus. chorus. now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, and young affection gapes to be his heir; that fair for which love groan d for and would die, with tender juliet match d, is now not fair. now romeo is belov d, and loves again, alike bewitched by the charm of looks; but to his foe suppos d he must complain, and she steal love s sweet bait from fearful hooks: being held a foe, he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; and she as much in love, her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere. but passion lends them power, time means, to meet, tempering extremities with extreme sweet. exit. scene i. an open place adjoining capulet s garden. enter romeo. romeo. can i go forward when my heart is here? turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. he climbs the wall and leaps down within it. enter benvolio and mercutio. benvolio. romeo! my cousin romeo! romeo! mercutio. he is wise, and on my life hath stol n him home to bed. benvolio. he ran this way, and leap d this orchard wall: call, good mercutio. mercutio. nay, i ll conjure too. romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! appear thou in the likeness of a sigh, speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied; cry but ah me! pronounce but love and dove; speak to my gossip venus one fair word, one nickname for her purblind son and heir, young abraham cupid, he that shot so trim when king cophetua lov d the beggar-maid. he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; the ape is dead, and i must conjure him. i conjure thee by rosaline s bright eyes, by her high forehead and her scarlet lip, by her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, and the demesnes that there adjacent lie, that in thy likeness thou appear to us. benvolio. an if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. mercutio. this cannot anger him. twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress circle, of some strange nature, letting it there stand till she had laid it, and conjur d it down; that were some spite. my invocation is fair and honest, and, in his mistress name, i conjure only but to raise up him. benvolio. come, he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night. blind is his love, and best befits the dark. mercutio. if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. now will he sit under a medlar tree, and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone. o romeo, that she were, o that she were an open-arse and thou a poperin pear! romeo, good night. i ll to my truckle-bed. this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep. come, shall we go? benvolio. go then; for tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found. exeunt. scene ii. capulet s garden. enter romeo. romeo. he jests at scars that never felt a wound. juliet appears above at a window. but soft, what light through yonder window breaks? it is the east, and juliet is the sun! arise fair sun and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair than she. be not her maid since she is envious; her vestal livery is but sick and green, and none but fools do wear it; cast it off. it is my lady, o it is my love! o, that she knew she were! she speaks, yet she says nothing. what of that? her eye discourses, i will answer it. i am too bold, tis not to me she speaks. two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, having some business, do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return. what if her eyes were there, they in her head? the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, as daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night. see how she leans her cheek upon her hand. o that i were a glove upon that hand, that i might touch that cheek. juliet. ay me. romeo. she speaks. o speak again bright angel, for thou art as glorious to this night, being o er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white-upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air. juliet. o romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou romeo? deny thy father and refuse thy name. or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and i ll no longer be a capulet. romeo. aside. shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this? juliet. tis but thy name that is my enemy; thou art thyself, though not a montague. what s montague? it is nor hand nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. o be some other name. what s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet; so romeo would, were he not romeo call d, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title. romeo, doff thy name, and for thy name, which is no part of thee, take all myself. romeo. i take thee at thy word. call me but love, and i ll be new baptis d; henceforth i never will be romeo. juliet. what man art thou that, thus bescreen d in night so stumblest on my counsel? romeo. by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am: my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. had i it written, i would tear the word. juliet. my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of thy tongue s utterance, yet i know the sound. art thou not romeo, and a montague? romeo. neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. juliet. how cam st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? the orchard walls are high and hard to climb, and the place death, considering who thou art, if any of my kinsmen find thee here. romeo. with love s light wings did i o erperch these walls, for stony limits cannot hold love out, and what love can do, that dares love attempt: therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. juliet. if they do see thee, they will murder thee. romeo. alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords. look thou but sweet, and i am proof against their enmity. juliet. i would not for the world they saw thee here. romeo. i have night s cloak to hide me from their eyes, and but thou love me, let them find me here. my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. juliet. by whose direction found st thou out this place? romeo. by love, that first did prompt me to enquire; he lent me counsel, and i lent him eyes. i am no pilot; yet wert thou as far as that vast shore wash d with the farthest sea, i should adventure for such merchandise. juliet. thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny what i have spoke; but farewell compliment. dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say ay, and i will take thy word. yet, if thou swear st, thou mayst prove false. at lovers perjuries, they say jove laughs. o gentle romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won, i ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay, so thou wilt woo. but else, not for the world. in truth, fair montague, i am too fond; and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light: but trust me, gentleman, i ll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange. i should have been more strange, i must confess, but that thou overheard st, ere i was ware, my true-love passion; therefore pardon me, and not impute this yielding to light love, which the dark night hath so discovered. romeo. lady, by yonder blessed moon i vow, that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops, juliet. o swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circled orb, lest that thy love prove likewise variable. romeo. what shall i swear by? juliet. do not swear at all. or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and i ll believe thee. romeo. if my heart s dear love, juliet. well, do not swear. although i joy in thee, i have no joy of this contract tonight; it is too rash, too unadvis d, too sudden, too like the lightning, which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens. sweet, good night. this bud of love, by summer s ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. good night, good night. as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast. romeo. o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? juliet. what satisfaction canst thou have tonight? romeo. th exchange of thy love s faithful vow for mine. juliet. i gave thee mine before thou didst request it; and yet i would it were to give again. romeo. would st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? juliet. but to be frank and give it thee again. and yet i wish but for the thing i have; my bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep; the more i give to thee, the more i have, for both are infinite. i hear some noise within. dear love, adieu. nurse calls within. anon, good nurse! sweet montague be true. stay but a little, i will come again. exit. romeo. o blessed, blessed night. i am afeard, being in night, all this is but a dream, too flattering sweet to be substantial. enter juliet above. juliet. three words, dear romeo, and good night indeed. if that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, by one that i ll procure to come to thee, where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, and all my fortunes at thy foot i ll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world. nurse. within. madam. juliet. i come, anon. but if thou meanest not well, i do beseech thee, nurse. within. madam. juliet. by and by i come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. tomorrow will i send. romeo. so thrive my soul, juliet. a thousand times good night. exit. romeo. a thousand times the worse, to want thy light. love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, but love from love, towards school with heavy looks. retiring slowly. re-enter juliet, above. juliet. hist! romeo, hist! o for a falconer s voice to lure this tassel-gentle back again. bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud, else would i tear the cave where echo lies, and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo s name. romeo. it is my soul that calls upon my name. how silver-sweet sound lovers tongues by night, like softest music to attending ears. juliet. romeo. romeo. my dear? juliet. what o clock tomorrow shall i send to thee? romeo. by the hour of nine. juliet. i will not fail. tis twenty years till then. i have forgot why i did call thee back. romeo. let me stand here till thou remember it. juliet. i shall forget, to have thee still stand there, remembering how i love thy company. romeo. and i ll still stay, to have thee still forget, forgetting any other home but this. juliet. tis almost morning; i would have thee gone, and yet no farther than a wanton s bird, that lets it hop a little from her hand, like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, and with a silk thread plucks it back again, so loving-jealous of his liberty. romeo. i would i were thy bird. juliet. sweet, so would i: yet i should kill thee with much cherishing. good night, good night. parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow. exit. romeo. sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast. would i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest. hence will i to my ghostly sire s cell, his help to crave and my dear hap to tell. exit. scene iii. friar lawrence s cell. enter friar lawrence with a basket. friar lawrence. the grey-ey d morn smiles on the frowning night, chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light; and fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day s pathway, made by titan s fiery wheels now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, the day to cheer, and night s dank dew to dry, i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. the earth that s nature s mother, is her tomb; what is her burying grave, that is her womb: and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find. many for many virtues excellent, none but for some, and yet all different. o, mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities. for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give; nor aught so good but, strain d from that fair use, revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. virtue itself turns vice being misapplied, and vice sometime s by action dignified. enter romeo. within the infant rind of this weak flower poison hath residence, and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant. romeo. good morrow, father. friar lawrence. benedicite! what early tongue so sweet saluteth me? young son, it argues a distemper d head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. care keeps his watch in every old man s eye, and where care lodges sleep will never lie; but where unbruised youth with unstuff d brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous d with some distemperature; or if not so, then here i hit it right, our romeo hath not been in bed tonight. romeo. that last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. friar lawrence. god pardon sin. wast thou with rosaline? romeo. with rosaline, my ghostly father? no. i have forgot that name, and that name s woe. friar lawrence. that s my good son. but where hast thou been then? romeo. i ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me that s by me wounded. both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies. i bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo, my intercession likewise steads my foe. friar lawrence. be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. romeo. then plainly know my heart s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet. as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; and all combin d, save what thou must combine by holy marriage. when, and where, and how we met, we woo d, and made exchange of vow, i ll tell thee as we pass; but this i pray, that thou consent to marry us today. friar lawrence. holy saint francis! what a change is here! is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken? young men s love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. jesu maria, what a deal of brine hath wash d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline! how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste. the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears. lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash d off yet. if ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline, and art thou chang d? pronounce this sentence then, women may fall, when there s no strength in men. romeo. thou chidd st me oft for loving rosaline. friar lawrence. for doting, not for loving, pupil mine. romeo. and bad st me bury love. friar lawrence. not in a grave to lay one in, another out to have. romeo. i pray thee chide me not, her i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow. the other did not so. friar lawrence. o, she knew well thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. but come young waverer, come go with me, in one respect i ll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn your households rancour to pure love. romeo. o let us hence; i stand on sudden haste. friar lawrence. wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. exeunt. scene iv. a street. enter benvolio and mercutio. mercutio. where the devil should this romeo be? came he not home tonight? benvolio. not to his father s; i spoke with his man. mercutio. why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad. benvolio. tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father s house. mercutio. a challenge, on my life. benvolio. romeo will answer it. mercutio. any man that can write may answer a letter. benvolio. nay, he will answer the letter s master, how he dares, being dared. mercutio. alas poor romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench s black eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy s butt-shaft. and is he a man to encounter tybalt? benvolio. why, what is tybalt? mercutio. more than prince of cats. o, he s the courageous captain of compliments. he fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion. he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. ah, the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay. benvolio. the what? mercutio. the pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners of accent. by jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good whore. why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardon-me s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? o their bones, their bones! enter romeo. benvolio. here comes romeo, here comes romeo! mercutio. without his roe, like a dried herring. o flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in. laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench, marry, she had a better love to berhyme her: dido a dowdy; cleopatra a gypsy; helen and hero hildings and harlots; thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. signior romeo, bonjour! there s a french salutation to your french slop. you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night. romeo. good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you? mercutio. the slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive? romeo. pardon, good mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. mercutio. that s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams. romeo. meaning, to curtsy. mercutio. thou hast most kindly hit it. romeo. a most courteous exposition. mercutio. nay, i am the very pink of courtesy. romeo. pink for flower. mercutio. right. romeo. why, then is my pump well flowered. mercutio. sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing, solely singular. romeo. o single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness! mercutio. come between us, good benvolio; my wits faint. romeo. swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or i ll cry a match. mercutio. nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done. for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than i am sure, i have in my whole five. was i with you there for the goose? romeo. thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the goose. mercutio. i will bite thee by the ear for that jest. romeo. nay, good goose, bite not. mercutio. thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce. romeo. and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose? mercutio. o here s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad. romeo. i stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. mercutio. why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. benvolio. stop there, stop there. mercutio. thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. benvolio. thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. mercutio. o, thou art deceived; i would have made it short, for i was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer. enter nurse and peter. romeo. here s goodly gear! a sail, a sail! mercutio. two, two; a shirt and a smock. nurse. peter! peter. anon. nurse. my fan, peter. mercutio. good peter, to hide her face; for her fan s the fairer face. nurse. god ye good morrow, gentlemen. mercutio. god ye good-den, fair gentlewoman. nurse. is it good-den? mercutio. tis no less, i tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon. nurse. out upon you! what a man are you? romeo. one, gentlewoman, that god hath made for himself to mar. nurse. by my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? gentlemen, can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo? romeo. i can tell you: but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him. i am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. nurse. you say well. mercutio. yea, is the worst well? very well took, i faith; wisely, wisely. nurse. if you be he, sir, i desire some confidence with you. benvolio. she will endite him to some supper. mercutio. a bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! romeo. what hast thou found? mercutio. no hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. sings. an old hare hoar, and an old hare hoar, is very good meat in lent; but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent. romeo, will you come to your father s? we ll to dinner thither. romeo. i will follow you. mercutio. farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady. exeunt mercutio and benvolio. nurse. i pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery? romeo. a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month. nurse. and a speak anything against me, i ll take him down, and a were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks. and if i cannot, i ll find those that shall. scurvy knave! i am none of his flirt-gills; i am none of his skains-mates. and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure! peter. i saw no man use you at his pleasure; if i had, my weapon should quickly have been out. i warrant you, i dare draw as soon as another man, if i see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side. nurse. now, afore god, i am so vexed that every part about me quivers. scurvy knave. pray you, sir, a word: and as i told you, my young lady bid me enquire you out; what she bade me say, i will keep to myself. but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young. and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. romeo. nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. i protest unto thee, nurse. good heart, and i faith i will tell her as much. lord, lord, she will be a joyful woman. romeo. what wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. nurse. i will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as i take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. romeo. bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon, and there she shall at friar lawrence cell be shriv d and married. here is for thy pains. nurse. no truly, sir; not a penny. romeo. go to; i say you shall. nurse. this afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. romeo. and stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall. within this hour my man shall be with thee, and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night. farewell, be trusty, and i ll quit thy pains; farewell; commend me to thy mistress. nurse. now god in heaven bless thee. hark you, sir. romeo. what say st thou, my dear nurse? nurse. is your man secret? did you ne er hear say, two may keep counsel, putting one away? romeo. i warrant thee my man s as true as steel. nurse. well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. lord, lord! when twas a little prating thing, o, there is a nobleman in town, one paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. i anger her sometimes, and tell her that paris is the properer man, but i ll warrant you, when i say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter? romeo. ay, nurse; what of that? both with an r. nurse. ah, mocker! that s the dog s name. r is for the no, i know it begins with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it. romeo. commend me to thy lady. nurse. ay, a thousand times. peter! exit romeo. peter. anon. nurse. before and apace. exeunt. scene v. capulet s garden. enter juliet. juliet. the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse, in half an hour she promised to return. perchance she cannot meet him. that s not so. o, she is lame. love s heralds should be thoughts, which ten times faster glides than the sun s beams, driving back shadows over lowering hills: therefore do nimble-pinion d doves draw love, and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings. now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day s journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours, yet she is not come. had she affections and warm youthful blood, she d be as swift in motion as a ball; my words would bandy her to my sweet love, and his to me. but old folks, many feign as they were dead; unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. enter nurse and peter. o god, she comes. o honey nurse, what news? hast thou met with him? send thy man away. nurse. peter, stay at the gate. exit peter. juliet. now, good sweet nurse, o lord, why look st thou sad? though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; if good, thou sham st the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face. nurse. i am aweary, give me leave awhile; fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have i had! juliet. i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news: nay come, i pray thee speak; good, good nurse, speak. nurse. jesu, what haste? can you not stay a while? do you not see that i am out of breath? juliet. how art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath? the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. is thy news good or bad? answer to that; say either, and i ll stay the circumstance. let me be satisfied, is t good or bad? nurse. well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man. romeo? no, not he. though his face be better than any man s, yet his leg excels all men s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. he is not the flower of courtesy, but i ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. go thy ways, wench, serve god. what, have you dined at home? juliet. no, no. but all this did i know before. what says he of our marriage? what of that? nurse. lord, how my head aches! what a head have i! it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. my back o t other side, o my back, my back! beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jauncing up and down. juliet. i faith, i am sorry that thou art not well. sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? nurse. your love says like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and i warrant a virtuous, where is your mother? juliet. where is my mother? why, she is within. where should she be? how oddly thou repliest. your love says, like an honest gentleman, where is your mother? nurse. o god s lady dear, are you so hot? marry, come up, i trow. is this the poultice for my aching bones? henceforward do your messages yourself. juliet. here s such a coil. come, what says romeo? nurse. have you got leave to go to shrift today? juliet. i have. nurse. then hie you hence to friar lawrence cell; there stays a husband to make you a wife. now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, they ll be in scarlet straight at any news. hie you to church. i must another way, to fetch a ladder by the which your love must climb a bird s nest soon when it is dark. i am the drudge, and toil in your delight; but you shall bear the burden soon at night. go. i ll to dinner; hie you to the cell. juliet. hie to high fortune! honest nurse, farewell. exeunt. scene vi. friar lawrence s cell. enter friar lawrence and romeo. friar lawrence. so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after-hours with sorrow chide us not. romeo. amen, amen, but come what sorrow can, it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight. do thou but close our hands with holy words, then love-devouring death do what he dare, it is enough i may but call her mine. friar lawrence. these violent delights have violent ends, and in their triumph die; like fire and powder, which as they kiss consume. the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness, and in the taste confounds the appetite. therefore love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. enter juliet. here comes the lady. o, so light a foot will ne er wear out the everlasting flint. a lover may bestride the gossamers that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall; so light is vanity. juliet. good even to my ghostly confessor. friar lawrence. romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. juliet. as much to him, else is his thanks too much. romeo. ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy be heap d like mine, and that thy skill be more to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air, and let rich music s tongue unfold the imagin d happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter. juliet. conceit more rich in matter than in words, brags of his substance, not of ornament. they are but beggars that can count their worth; but my true love is grown to such excess, i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. friar lawrence. come, come with me, and we will make short work, for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one. exeunt. act iii scene i. a public place. enter mercutio, benvolio, page and servants. benvolio. i pray thee, good mercutio, let s retire: the day is hot, the capulets abroad, and if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl, for now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. mercutio. thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says god send me no need of thee! and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. benvolio. am i like such a fellow? mercutio. come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved. benvolio. and what to? mercutio. nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. thou? why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter? with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling! benvolio. and i were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. mercutio. the fee simple! o simple! enter tybalt and others. benvolio. by my head, here comes the capulets. mercutio. by my heel, i care not. tybalt. follow me close, for i will speak to them. gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you. mercutio. and but one word with one of us? couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. tybalt. you shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me occasion. mercutio. could you not take some occasion without giving? tybalt. mercutio, thou consortest with romeo. mercutio. consort? what, dost thou make us minstrels? and thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. here s my fiddlestick, here s that shall make you dance. zounds, consort! benvolio. we talk here in the public haunt of men. either withdraw unto some private place, and reason coldly of your grievances, or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. mercutio. men s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. i will not budge for no man s pleasure, i. enter romeo. tybalt. well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man. mercutio. but i ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery. marry, go before to field, he ll be your follower; your worship in that sense may call him man. tybalt. romeo, the love i bear thee can afford no better term than this: thou art a villain. romeo. tybalt, the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting. villain am i none; therefore farewell; i see thou know st me not. tybalt. boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw. romeo. i do protest i never injur d thee, but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love. and so good capulet, which name i tender as dearly as mine own, be satisfied. mercutio. o calm, dishonourable, vile submission! draws. alla stoccata carries it away. tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? tybalt. what wouldst thou have with me? mercutio. good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that i mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out. tybalt. drawing. i am for you. romeo. gentle mercutio, put thy rapier up. mercutio. come, sir, your passado. they fight. romeo. draw, benvolio; beat down their weapons. gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage, tybalt, mercutio, the prince expressly hath forbid this bandying in verona streets. hold, tybalt! good mercutio! exeunt tybalt with his partizans. mercutio. i am hurt. a plague o both your houses. i am sped. is he gone, and hath nothing? benvolio. what, art thou hurt? mercutio. ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. marry, tis enough. where is my page? go villain, fetch a surgeon. exit page. romeo. courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. mercutio. no, tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but tis enough, twill serve. ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. i am peppered, i warrant, for this world. a plague o both your houses. zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death. a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! why the devil came you between us? i was hurt under your arm. romeo. i thought all for the best. mercutio. help me into some house, benvolio, or i shall faint. a plague o both your houses. they have made worms meat of me. i have it, and soundly too. your houses! exeunt mercutio and benvolio. romeo. this gentleman, the prince s near ally, my very friend, hath got his mortal hurt in my behalf; my reputation stain d with tybalt s slander, tybalt, that an hour hath been my cousin. o sweet juliet, thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper soften d valour s steel. re-enter benvolio. benvolio. o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio s dead, that gallant spirit hath aspir d the clouds, which too untimely here did scorn the earth. romeo. this day s black fate on mo days doth depend; this but begins the woe others must end. re-enter tybalt. benvolio. here comes the furious tybalt back again. romeo. again in triumph, and mercutio slain? away to heaven respective lenity, and fire-ey d fury be my conduct now! now, tybalt, take the villain back again that late thou gav st me, for mercutio s soul is but a little way above our heads, staying for thine to keep him company. either thou or i, or both, must go with him. tybalt. thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence. romeo. this shall determine that. they fight; tybalt falls. benvolio. romeo, away, be gone! the citizens are up, and tybalt slain. stand not amaz d. the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken. hence, be gone, away! romeo. o, i am fortune s fool! benvolio. why dost thou stay? exit romeo. enter citizens. first citizen. which way ran he that kill d mercutio? tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? benvolio. there lies that tybalt. first citizen. up, sir, go with me. i charge thee in the prince s name obey. enter prince, attended; montague, capulet, their wives and others. prince. where are the vile beginners of this fray? benvolio. o noble prince, i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. there lies the man, slain by young romeo, that slew thy kinsman, brave mercutio. lady capulet. tybalt, my cousin! o my brother s child! o prince! o husband! o, the blood is spill d of my dear kinsman! prince, as thou art true, for blood of ours shed blood of montague. o cousin, cousin. prince. benvolio, who began this bloody fray? benvolio. tybalt, here slain, whom romeo s hand did slay; romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was, and urg d withal your high displeasure. all this uttered with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow d could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio s breast, who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats cold death aside, and with the other sends it back to tybalt, whose dexterity retorts it. romeo he cries aloud, hold, friends! friends, part! and swifter than his tongue, his agile arm beats down their fatal points, and twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled. but by and by comes back to romeo, who had but newly entertain d revenge, and to t they go like lightning; for, ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain; and as he fell did romeo turn and fly. this is the truth, or let benvolio die. lady capulet. he is a kinsman to the montague. affection makes him false, he speaks not true. some twenty of them fought in this black strife, and all those twenty could but kill one life. i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not live. prince. romeo slew him, he slew mercutio. who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? montague. not romeo, prince, he was mercutio s friend; his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of tybalt. prince. and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence. i have an interest in your hate s proceeding, my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding. but i ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine. i will be deaf to pleading and excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. therefore use none. let romeo hence in haste, else, when he is found, that hour is his last. bear hence this body, and attend our will. mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. exeunt. scene ii. a room in capulet s house. enter juliet. juliet. gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards phoebus lodging. such a waggoner as phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately. spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway s eyes may wink, and romeo leap to these arms, untalk d of and unseen. lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties: or, if love be blind, it best agrees with night. come, civil night, thou sober-suited matron, all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match, play d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. hood my unmann d blood, bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, think true love acted simple modesty. come, night, come romeo; come, thou day in night; for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven s back. come gentle night, come loving black-brow d night, give me my romeo, and when i shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun. o, i have bought the mansion of a love, but not possess d it; and though i am sold, not yet enjoy d. so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse, and she brings news, and every tongue that speaks but romeo s name speaks heavenly eloquence. enter nurse, with cords. now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there? the cords that romeo bid thee fetch? nurse. ay, ay, the cords. throws them down. juliet. ay me, what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? nurse. ah, well-a-day, he s dead, he s dead, he s dead! we are undone, lady, we are undone. alack the day, he s gone, he s kill d, he s dead. juliet. can heaven be so envious? nurse. romeo can, though heaven cannot. o romeo, romeo. who ever would have thought it? romeo! juliet. what devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? this torture should be roar d in dismal hell. hath romeo slain himself? say thou but ay, and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. i am not i if there be such an i; or those eyes shut that make thee answer ay. if he be slain, say ay; or if not, no. brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. nurse. i saw the wound, i saw it with mine eyes, god save the mark! here on his manly breast. a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub d in blood, all in gore-blood. i swounded at the sight. juliet. o, break, my heart. poor bankrout, break at once. to prison, eyes; ne er look on liberty. vile earth to earth resign; end motion here, and thou and romeo press one heavy bier. nurse. o tybalt, tybalt, the best friend i had. o courteous tybalt, honest gentleman! that ever i should live to see thee dead. juliet. what storm is this that blows so contrary? is romeo slaughter d and is tybalt dead? my dearest cousin, and my dearer lord? then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom, for who is living, if those two are gone? nurse. tybalt is gone, and romeo banished, romeo that kill d him, he is banished. juliet. o god! did romeo s hand shed tybalt s blood? nurse. it did, it did; alas the day, it did. juliet. o serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical, dove-feather d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb! despised substance of divinest show! just opposite to what thou justly seem st, a damned saint, an honourable villain! o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace. nurse. there s no trust, no faith, no honesty in men. all perjur d, all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. ah, where s my man? give me some aqua vitae. these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. shame come to romeo. juliet. blister d be thy tongue for such a wish! he was not born to shame. upon his brow shame is asham d to sit; for tis a throne where honour may be crown d sole monarch of the universal earth. o, what a beast was i to chide at him! nurse. will you speak well of him that kill d your cousin? juliet. shall i speak ill of him that is my husband? ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, when i thy three-hours wife have mangled it? but wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? that villain cousin would have kill d my husband. back, foolish tears, back to your native spring, your tributary drops belong to woe, which you mistaking offer up to joy. my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain, and tybalt s dead, that would have slain my husband. all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then? some word there was, worser than tybalt s death, that murder d me. i would forget it fain, but o, it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds. tybalt is dead, and romeo banished. that banished, that one word banished, hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt s death was woe enough, if it had ended there. or if sour woe delights in fellowship, and needly will be rank d with other griefs, why follow d not, when she said tybalt s dead, thy father or thy mother, nay or both, which modern lamentation might have mov d? but with a rear-ward following tybalt s death, romeo is banished to speak that word is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, all slain, all dead. romeo is banished, there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word s death, no words can that woe sound. where is my father and my mother, nurse? nurse. weeping and wailing over tybalt s corse. will you go to them? i will bring you thither. juliet. wash they his wounds with tears. mine shall be spent, when theirs are dry, for romeo s banishment. take up those cords. poor ropes, you are beguil d, both you and i; for romeo is exil d. he made you for a highway to my bed, but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed. come cords, come nurse, i ll to my wedding bed, and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead. nurse. hie to your chamber. i ll find romeo to comfort you. i wot well where he is. hark ye, your romeo will be here at night. i ll to him, he is hid at lawrence cell. juliet. o find him, give this ring to my true knight, and bid him come to take his last farewell. exeunt. scene iii. friar lawrence s cell. enter friar lawrence. friar lawrence. romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. affliction is enanmour d of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity. enter romeo. romeo. father, what news? what is the prince s doom? what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, that i yet know not? friar lawrence. too familiar is my dear son with such sour company. i bring thee tidings of the prince s doom. romeo. what less than doomsday is the prince s doom? friar lawrence. a gentler judgment vanish d from his lips, not body s death, but body s banishment. romeo. ha, banishment? be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look, much more than death. do not say banishment. friar lawrence. hence from verona art thou banished. be patient, for the world is broad and wide. romeo. there is no world without verona walls, but purgatory, torture, hell itself. hence banished is banish d from the world, and world s exile is death. then banished is death misterm d. calling death banished, thou cutt st my head off with a golden axe, and smilest upon the stroke that murders me. friar lawrence. o deadly sin, o rude unthankfulness! thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince, taking thy part, hath brush d aside the law, and turn d that black word death to banishment. this is dear mercy, and thou see st it not. romeo. tis torture, and not mercy. heaven is here where juliet lives, and every cat and dog, and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her, but romeo may not. more validity, more honourable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet s hand, and steal immortal blessing from her lips, who, even in pure and vestal modesty still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin. but romeo may not, he is banished. this may flies do, when i from this must fly. they are free men but i am banished. and say st thou yet that exile is not death? hadst thou no poison mix d, no sharp-ground knife, no sudden mean of death, though ne er so mean, but banished to kill me? banished? o friar, the damned use that word in hell. howling attends it. how hast thou the heart, being a divine, a ghostly confessor, a sin-absolver, and my friend profess d, to mangle me with that word banished? friar lawrence. thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little, romeo. o, thou wilt speak again of banishment. friar lawrence. i ll give thee armour to keep off that word, adversity s sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, though thou art banished. romeo. yet banished? hang up philosophy. unless philosophy can make a juliet, displant a town, reverse a prince s doom, it helps not, it prevails not, talk no more. friar lawrence. o, then i see that mad men have no ears. romeo. how should they, when that wise men have no eyes? friar lawrence. let me dispute with thee of thy estate. romeo. thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, an hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me, and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, and fall upon the ground as i do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave. knocking within. friar lawrence. arise; one knocks. good romeo, hide thyself. romeo. not i, unless the breath of heartsick groans mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. knocking. friar lawrence. hark, how they knock! who s there? romeo, arise, thou wilt be taken. stay awhile. stand up. knocking. run to my study. by-and-by. god s will, what simpleness is this. i come, i come. knocking. who knocks so hard? whence come you, what s your will? nurse. within. let me come in, and you shall know my errand. i come from lady juliet. friar lawrence. welcome then. enter nurse. nurse. o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar, where is my lady s lord, where s romeo? friar lawrence. there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. nurse. o, he is even in my mistress case. just in her case! o woeful sympathy! piteous predicament. even so lies she, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man. for juliet s sake, for her sake, rise and stand. why should you fall into so deep an o? romeo. nurse. nurse. ah sir, ah sir, death s the end of all. romeo. spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her? doth not she think me an old murderer, now i have stain d the childhood of our joy with blood remov d but little from her own? where is she? and how doth she? and what says my conceal d lady to our cancell d love? nurse. o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; and now falls on her bed, and then starts up, and tybalt calls, and then on romeo cries, and then down falls again. romeo. as if that name, shot from the deadly level of a gun, did murder her, as that name s cursed hand murder d her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me, in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sack the hateful mansion. drawing his sword. friar lawrence. hold thy desperate hand. art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art. thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast. unseemly woman in a seeming man, and ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! thou hast amaz d me. by my holy order, i thought thy disposition better temper d. hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? and slay thy lady, that in thy life lives, by doing damned hate upon thyself? why rail st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth? since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. fie, fie, thou sham st thy shape, thy love, thy wit, which, like a usurer, abound st in all, and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. thy noble shape is but a form of wax, digressing from the valour of a man; thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, killing that love which thou hast vow d to cherish; thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, misshapen in the conduct of them both, like powder in a skilless soldier s flask, is set afire by thine own ignorance, and thou dismember d with thine own defence. what, rouse thee, man. thy juliet is alive, for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. there art thou happy. tybalt would kill thee, but thou slew st tybalt; there art thou happy. the law that threaten d death becomes thy friend, and turns it to exile; there art thou happy. a pack of blessings light upon thy back; happiness courts thee in her best array; but like a misshaped and sullen wench, thou putt st up thy fortune and thy love. take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. go, get thee to thy love as was decreed, ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her. but look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to mantua; where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went st forth in lamentation. go before, nurse. commend me to thy lady, and bid her hasten all the house to bed, which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto. romeo is coming. nurse. o lord, i could have stay d here all the night to hear good counsel. o, what learning is! my lord, i ll tell my lady you will come. romeo. do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. nurse. here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir. hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. exit. romeo. how well my comfort is reviv d by this. friar lawrence. go hence, good night, and here stands all your state: either be gone before the watch be set, or by the break of day disguis d from hence. sojourn in mantua. i ll find out your man, and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here. give me thy hand; tis late; farewell; good night. romeo. but that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief so brief to part with thee. farewell. exeunt. scene iv. a room in capulet s house. enter capulet, lady capulet and paris. capulet. things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter. look you, she lov d her kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did i. well, we were born to die. tis very late; she ll not come down tonight. i promise you, but for your company, i would have been abed an hour ago. paris. these times of woe afford no tune to woo. madam, good night. commend me to your daughter. lady capulet. i will, and know her mind early tomorrow; tonight she s mew d up to her heaviness. capulet. sir paris, i will make a desperate tender of my child s love. i think she will be rul d in all respects by me; nay more, i doubt it not. wife, go you to her ere you go to bed, acquaint her here of my son paris love, and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next, but, soft, what day is this? paris. monday, my lord. capulet. monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon, a thursday let it be; a thursday, tell her, she shall be married to this noble earl. will you be ready? do you like this haste? we ll keep no great ado, a friend or two, for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late, it may be thought we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much. therefore we ll have some half a dozen friends, and there an end. but what say you to thursday? paris. my lord, i would that thursday were tomorrow. capulet. well, get you gone. a thursday be it then. go you to juliet ere you go to bed, prepare her, wife, against this wedding day. farewell, my lord. light to my chamber, ho! afore me, it is so very very late that we may call it early by and by. good night. exeunt. scene v. an open gallery to juliet s chamber, overlooking the garden. enter romeo and juliet. juliet. wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day. it was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierc d the fearful hollow of thine ear; nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. believe me, love, it was the nightingale. romeo. it was the lark, the herald of the morn, no nightingale. look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. night s candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. i must be gone and live, or stay and die. juliet. yond light is not daylight, i know it, i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua. therefore stay yet, thou need st not to be gone. romeo. let me be ta en, let me be put to death, i am content, so thou wilt have it so. i ll say yon grey is not the morning s eye, tis but the pale reflex of cynthia s brow. nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads. i have more care to stay than will to go. come, death, and welcome. juliet wills it so. how is t, my soul? let s talk. it is not day. juliet. it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away. it is the lark that sings so out of tune, straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. some say the lark makes sweet division; this doth not so, for she divideth us. some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes. o, now i would they had chang d voices too, since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, hunting thee hence with hunt s-up to the day. o now be gone, more light and light it grows. romeo. more light and light, more dark and dark our woes. enter nurse. nurse. madam. juliet. nurse?

love, lord, ay husband, friend, i must hear from thee every day in the hour, for in a minute there are many days. o, by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo. romeo. farewell! i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings, love, to thee. juliet. o thinkest thou we shall ever meet again? romeo. i doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come. juliet. o god! i have an ill-divining soul! methinks i see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. either my eyesight fails, or thou look st pale. romeo. and trust me, love, in my eye so do you. dry sorrow drinks our blood. adieu, adieu. exit below. juliet. o fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle, if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him that is renown d for faith? be fickle, fortune; for then, i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back. lady capulet. within. ho, daughter, are you up? juliet. who is t that calls? is it my lady mother? is she not down so late, or up so early? what unaccustom d cause procures her hither? enter lady capulet. lady capulet. why, how now, juliet? juliet. madam, i am not well. lady capulet. evermore weeping for your cousin s death? what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? and if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. therefore have done: some grief shows much of love, but much of grief shows still some want of wit. juliet. yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. lady capulet. so shall you feel the loss, but not the friend which you weep for. juliet. feeling so the loss, i cannot choose but ever weep the friend. lady capulet. well, girl, thou weep st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter d him. juliet. what villain, madam? lady capulet. that same villain romeo. juliet. villain and he be many miles asunder. god pardon him. i do, with all my heart. and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. lady capulet. that is because the traitor murderer lives. juliet. ay madam, from the reach of these my hands. would none but i might venge my cousin s death. lady capulet. we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. then weep no more. i ll send to one in mantua, where that same banish d runagate doth live, shall give him such an unaccustom d dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company: and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied. juliet. indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him dead is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex d. madam, if you could find out but a man to bear a poison, i would temper it, that romeo should upon receipt thereof, soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhors to hear him nam d, and cannot come to him, to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that hath slaughter d him. lady capulet. find thou the means, and i ll find such a man. but now i ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. juliet. and joy comes well in such a needy time. what are they, i beseech your ladyship? lady capulet. well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; one who to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, that thou expects not, nor i look d not for. juliet. madam, in happy time, what day is that?

a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? evermore showering? in one little body thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind. for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea, do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs, who raging with thy tears and they with them, without a sudden calm will overset thy tempest-tossed body. how now, wife? have you deliver d to her our decree? lady capulet. ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. i would the fool were married to her grave. capulet. soft. take me with you, take me with you, wife. how, will she none? doth she not give us thanks? is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? juliet. not proud you have, but thankful that you have. proud can i never be of what i hate; but thankful even for hate that is meant love. capulet. how now, how now, chopp d logic?

what can he say to this? balthasar. i brought my master news of juliet s death, and then in post he came from mantua to this same place, to this same monument. this letter he early bid me give his father, and threaten d me with death, going in the vault, if i departed not, and left him there. prince. give me the letter, i will look on it. where is the county s page that rais d the watch? sirrah, what made your master in this place? page. he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave, and bid me stand aloof, and so i did. anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, and by and by my master drew on him, and then i ran away to call the watch. prince. this letter doth make good the friar s words, their course of love, the tidings of her death. and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary, and therewithal came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet. where be these enemies?

of syracusa, plead no more; i am not partial to infringe our laws: the enmity and discord which of late 5 sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives, have seal d his rigorous statutes with their bloods, excludes all pity from our threatening looks. 10 for, since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, it hath in solemn synods been decreed, both by the syracusians and ourselves, to admit no traffic to our adverse towns: 15 nay, more, if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs; again: if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus, he dies, 20 his goods confiscate to the duke s dispose; unless a thousand marks be levied, to quit the penalty and to ransom him. thy substance, valued at the highest rate, cannot amount unto a hundred marks; 25 therefore by law thou art condemn d to die. ge. yet this my comfort: when your words are done, my woes end likewise with the evening sun. duke. well, syracusian, say, in brief, the cause why thou departed st from thy native home, 30 and for what cause thou camest to ephesus. ge. a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable: yet, that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, 35 i ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. in syracusa was i born; and wed unto a woman, happy but for me, and by me, had not our hap been bad. with her i lived in joy; our wealth increased 40 by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum; till my factor s death, and the great care of goods at random left, drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: from whom my absence was not six months old, 45 before herself, almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear, had made provision for her following me, and soon and safe arrived where i was. there had she not been long but she became 50 a joyful mother of two goodly sons; and, which was strange, the one so like the other as could not be distinguish d but by names. that very hour, and in the self-same inn, a meaner woman was delivered 55 of such a burden, male twins, both alike: those, for their parents were exceeding poor, i bought, and brought up to attend my sons. my wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, made daily motions for our home return: 60 unwilling i agreed; alas! too soon we came aboard. a league from epidamnum had we sail d, before the always-wind-obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm: 65 but longer did we not retain much hope; for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death; which though myself would gladly have embraced, 70 yet the incessant weepings of my wife, weeping before for what she saw must come, and piteous plainings of the pretty babes, that mourn d for fashion, ignorant what to fear, forced me to seek delays for them and me. 75 and this it was, for other means was none: the sailors sought for safety by our boat, and left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: my wife, more careful for the latter-born, had fasten d him unto a small spare mast, 80 such as seafaring men provide for storms; to him one of the other twins was bound, whilst i had been like heedful of the other: the children thus disposed, my wife and i, fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix d, 85 fasten d ourselves at either end the mast; and floating straight, obedient to the stream, was carried towards corinth, as we thought. at length the sun, gazing upon the earth, dispersed those vapours that offended us; 90 and, by the benefit of his wished light, the seas wax d calm, and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us, of corinth that, of epidaurus this: but ere they came,--o, let me say no more! 95 gather the sequel by that went before. duke. nay, forward, old man; do not break off so; for we may pity, though not pardon thee. ge. o, had the gods done so, i had not now worthily term d them merciless to us! 100 for, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, we were encounter d by a mighty rock; which being violently borne upon, our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; so that, in this unjust divorce of us, 105 fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in, what to sorrow for. her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened with lesser weight, but not with lesser woe, was carried with more speed before the wind; 110 and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth, as we thought. at length, another ship had seized on us; and, knowing whom it was their hap to save, gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck d guests; 115 and would have reft the fishers of their prey, had not their bark been very slow of sail; and therefore homeward did they bend their course. thus have you heard me sever d from my bliss; that by misfortunes was my life prolong d, 120 to tell sad stories of my own mishaps. duke. and, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall n of them and thee till now. ge. my youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, 125 at eighteen years became

labour d of a love to see, i hazarded the loss of whom i loved. five summers have i spent in furthest greece, roaming clean through the bounds of asia, and, coasting homeward, came to ephesus; 135 hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought or that, or any place that harbours men. but here must end the story of my life; and happy were i in my timely death, could all my travels warrant me they

will i favour thee in what i can. 150 therefore, merchant, i ll limit thee this day to seek thy help by beneficial help: try all the friends thou hast in ephesus; beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, and live; if no, then thou art doom d to die. 155 gaoler, take him to thy custody. gaol. i will, my lord. ge. hopeless and helpless doth geon wend, but to procrastinate his lifeless end. exeunt.

s. go bear it to the centaur, where we host, and stay there, dromio, till i come to thee. 10 within this hour it will be dinner-time: till that. i ll view the manners of the town, peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, and then return, and sleep within mine inn; for with long travel i am stiff and weary. 15 get thee away. dro. s. many a man would take you at your word, and go indeed, having so good a mean. exit. ant. s. a trusty villain, sir; that very oft, when i am dull with care and melancholy, 20 lightens my humour with his merry jests. what, will you walk with me about the town, and then go to my inn, and dine with me? first mer. i am invited, sir, to certain merchants, of whom i hope to make much benefit; 25 i crave your pardon. soon at five o clock, please you, i ll meet with you upon the mart, and afterward consort you till bed-time: my present business calls me from you now. ant. s. farewell till then: i will go lose myself, 30 and wander up and down to view the city.

dromio of ephesus . here comes the almanac of my true date. what now? how chance thou art return d so soon? dro. e. return d so soon! rather approach d too late: the capon burns, the pig falls from the spit; the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; 45 my mistress made it one upon my cheek: she is so hot, because the meat is cold; the meat is cold, because you come not home; you come not home, because you have no stomach; you have no stomach, having broke your fast; 50 but we, that know what tis to fast and pray, are penitent for your default to-day. ant. s. stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, i pray: where have you left the money that i gave you? dro. e. o,--sixpence, that i had o wednesday last 55 to pay the saddler for my mistress crupper? the saddler had it, sir; i kept it not. ant. s. i am not in a sportive humour now: tell me, and dally not, where is the money? we being strangers here, how darest thou trust 60 so great a charge from thine own custody? dro. e. i pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner: i from my mistress come to you in post; if i return, i shall be post indeed, for she will score your fault upon my pate. 65 methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, and strike you home without a messenger. ant. s. come, dromio, come, these jests are out of season; reserve them till a merrier hour than this. where is the gold i gave in charge to thee? 70 dro. e. to me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me. ant. s. come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge. dro. e. my charge was but to fetch you

mistress marks upon my shoulders; but not a thousand marks between you both. if i should pay your worship those again, 85 perchance you will not bear them patiently. ant. s. thy mistress marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou? dro. e. your worship s wife, my mistress at the ph nix; she that doth fast till you come home to dinner, and prays that you will hie you home to dinner. 90 ant. s. what, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, being forbid? there, take you that, sir knave. dro. e. what mean you, sir? for god s sake, hold your hands! nay, an you will not, sir, i ll take my heels. exit.

dine, and never fret: a man is master of his liberty: time is their master; and when they see time, they ll go or come: if so, be patient, sister. adr. why should their liberty than ours be more? 10

why, headstrong liberty is lash d with woe. 15 there s nothing situate under heaven s eye but hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky: the beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, are their males subjects and at their controls: men, more divine, the masters of all these, 20 lords of the wide world and wild watery seas, indued with intellectual sense and souls, of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls, are masters to their females, and their lords: then let your will attend on their accords. 25 adr. this servitude makes you to keep unwed. luc. not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

like weight of pain, as much, or more, we should ourselves complain: so thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me; but, if thou live to see like right bereft, 40 this fool-begg d patience in thee will be left. luc. well, i will marry one day, but to try. here comes your man; now is your husband nigh. enter dromio of ephesus . adr. say, is your tardy master now at hand? dro. e. nay, he s at two hands with me, and that my 45 two ears can witness. adr. say, didst thou speak with him? know st thou his mind? dro. e. ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear: beshrew his hand, i scarce could understand it. luc. spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his 50 meaning? dro. e. nay, he struck so plainly, i could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that i could scarce understand them. adr. but say, i prithee, is he coming home? 55 it seems he hath great care to please his wife. dro. e. why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad. adr. horn-mad, thou villain! dro. e. i mean not cuckold-mad; but, sure, he is stark mad. when i desired him to come home to dinner, 60 he ask d me for a thousand marks in gold: tis dinner-time, quoth i; my gold! quoth he: your meat doth burn, quoth i; my gold! quoth he: will you come home? quoth i; my gold! quoth he, where is the thousand marks i gave thee, villain? 65 the pig, quoth i, is burn d; my gold! quoth he: my mistress, sir, quoth i; hang up thy mistress! i know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress! luc. quoth who? dro. e. quoth my master: 70 i know, quoth he, no house, no wife, no mistress. so that my errand, due unto my tongue, i thank him, i bare home upon my shoulders; for, in conclusion, he did beat me there. adr. go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home. 75 dro. e. go back again, and be new beaten home? for god s sake, send some other messenger. adr. back, slave, or i will break thy pate across. dro. e. and he will bless that cross with other beating: between you i shall have a holy head. 80 adr. hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home. dro. e. am i so round with you as you with me, that like a football you do spurn me thus? you

him not ruin d? then is he the ground of my defeatures. my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair: but, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale, 100 and feeds from home; poor i am but his

you know he promised me a chain; would that alone, alone he would detain, so he would keep fair quarter with his bed! i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still, 110

use these blows long, i must get a sconce for my head, and insconce it too; or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders. but, i pray, sir, why am i beaten? ant. s. dost thou not know? 40 dro. s.

no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. ant. s. may he not do it by fine and recovery? dro. s. yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man. 75 ant. s. why is time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement? dro. s. because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts: and what he hath scanted men in hair, he hath given them in wit. 80 ant. s. why, but there s many a man hath more hair than wit. dro. s. not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair. ant. s. why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain 85

you. dro. s. sure ones, then. ant. s. nay, not sure, in a thing falsing. dro. s. certain ones, then. ant. s. name them. 95 dro. s. the one, to save the money that he spends in trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. ant. s. you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things. 100 dro. s. marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature. ant. s. but your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover. dro. s. thus i mend it: time himself is bald, and 105 therefore to the world s end will have bald followers. ant. s. i knew twould be a bald conclusion: but, soft! who wafts us yonder? enter adriana and luciana. adr. ay, ay, antipholus, look strange and frown: some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects; 110 i am not adriana nor thy wife. the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear, that never object pleasing in thine eye, that never touch well welcome to thy hand, 115 that never meat sweet-savour d in thy taste, unless i spake, or look d, or touch d, or carved to thee. how comes it now, my husband, o, how comes it, that thou art then estranged from thyself? thyself i call it, being strange to me, 120 that, undividable, incorporate, am better than thy dear self s better part. ah, do not tear away thyself from me! for know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf, 125 and take unmingled thence that drop again, without addition or diminishing, as take from me thyself, and not me too. how dearly would it touch thee to the quick, shouldst thou but hear i were licentious, 130 and that this body, consecrate to thee, by ruffian lust should be contaminate! wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me, and hurl the name of husband in my face, and tear the stain d skin off my harlot-brow, 135 and from my false hand cut the wedding-ring, and break it with a deep-divorcing vow? i know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it. i am possess d with an adulterate blot; my blood is mingled with the crime of lust: 140 for if we two be one, and thou play false, i do digest the poison of thy flesh, being strumpeted by thy contagion. keep, then, fair league and truce with thy true bed; i live distain d, thou undishonoured. 145 ant. s. plead you to me, fair dame? i know you not: in ephesus i am but two hours old, as strange unto your town as to your talk; who, every word by all my wit being scann d, wants wit in all one word to understand. 150 luc. fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! when were you wont to use my sister thus? she sent for you by dromio home to dinner. ant. s. by dromio? dro. s. by me? 155 adr. by thee; and this thou didst return from him, that he did buffet thee, and, in his blows, denied my house for his, me for his wife. ant. s. did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? what is the course and drift of your compact? 160 dro. s. i, sir? i never saw her till this time. ant. s. villain, thou liest; for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart. dro. s. i never spake with her in all my life. ant. s. how can she thus, then, call us by our names, 165 unless it be by inspiration. adr. how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, abetting him to thwart me in my mood! be it my wrong you are from me exempt, 170 but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. come, i will fasten on this sleeve of thine: thou art an elm, my husband, i a vine, whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, makes me with thy strength to communicate: 175 if aught possess thee from me, it is dross, usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion. ant. s. to me she speaks; she moves me for her theme: 180 what, was i married to her in my dream? or sleep i now, and think i hear all this? what error drives our eyes and ears amiss? until i know this sure uncertainty, i ll entertain the offer d fallacy. 185 luc. dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner. dro. s. o, for my beads! i cross me for a sinner. this is the fairy land;--o spite of spites! we talk with goblins, owls, and sprites: if we obey them not, this will ensue, 190 they ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue. luc. why pratest thou to thyself, and answer st not? dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot! dro. s. i am transformed, master, am i not? ant. s. i think thou art in mind, and so am i. 195 dro. s. nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. ant. s. thou hast thine own form. dro. s. no, i am an ape. luc. if thou art chang d to aught, tis to an ass. dro. s. tis true; she rides me, and i long for grass. tis so, i am an ass; else it could never be

home. 5 but here s a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart, and that i beat him, and charged him with a thousand marks in gold, and that i did deny my wife and house. thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this? 10 dro. e. say what you will, sir, but i know what i know; that you beat me at the mart, i have your hand to show: if the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, your own handwriting would tell you what i think. ant. e. i think thou art an ass. dro. e. marry, so it doth appear 15 by the wrongs i suffer, and the blows i bear. i should kick, being kick d; and, being at that pass, you would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass. ant. e. you re sad, signior balthazar: pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here. 20 bal. i hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. ant. e. o, signior balthazar, either at flesh or fish, a table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish. bal. good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. ant. e. and welcome more common; for that s nothing but words. 25 bal. small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. ant. e. ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest: but though my cates be mean, take them in good part; better cheer may you have, but not with better heart. but, soft! my door is lock d.--go bid them let us in. 30 dro. e. maud,

70 your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold: it would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold. ant. e. go fetch me something: i ll break ope the gate. dro. s. within break

well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you. be ruled by me: depart in patience, and let us to the tiger all to dinner; 95 and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint. if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day, a vulgar comment will be made of it, 100 and that supposed by the common rout against your yet ungalled estimation, that may with foul intrusion enter in, and dwell upon your grave when you are dead; for slander lives upon succession, 105 for ever housed where it gets possession. ant. e. you

office? shall, antipholus, even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot? shall love, in building, grow so ruinous? if you did wed my sister for her wealth, 5 then for her wealth s sake use her with more kindness: or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth; muffle your false love with some show of blindness: let not my sister read it in your eye; be not thy tongue thy own shame s orator; 10 look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty; apparel vice like virtue s harbinger; bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted; teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; be secret-false: what need she be acquainted? 15 what simple thief brags of his own attaint? tis double wrong, to truant with your bed, and let her read it in thy looks at board: shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; ill deeds are doubled with an evil word. 20 alas, poor women! make us but believe, being compact of credit, that you love us; though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; we in your motion turn, and you may move us. then, gentle brother, get you in again; 25 comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife: tis holy sport, to be a little vain, when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife. ant. s. sweet mistress,--what your name is else, i know not, nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,-- 30 less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth s wonder; more than earth divine. teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak; lay open to my earthy-gross conceit, smother d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak, 35 the folded meaning of your words deceit. against my soul s pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field? are you a god? would you create me new? transform me, then, and to your power i ll yield. 40 but if that i am i, then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine, nor to her bed no homage do i owe: far more, far more to you do i decline. o, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note, 45 to drown me in thy sister flood of tears: sing, siren, for thyself, and i will dote: spread o er the silver waves thy golden hairs, and as a bed i ll take them, and there lie; and, in that glorious supposition, think 50 he gains by death that hath such means to die: let love, being light, be drowned if she sink! luc. what, are you mad, that you do reason so? ant. s. not mad, but mated; how, i do not know. luc. it is a fault that springeth from your eye. 55 ant. s. for gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by. luc. gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight. ant. s. as good to wink, sweet love, as look on night. luc. why call you me love? call my sister so. ant. s. thy sister s sister. luc. that s my sister. ant. s. no; 60 it is thyself, mine own self s better part, mine eye s clear eye, my dear heart s dearer heart, my food, my fortune, and my sweet hope s aim, my sole earth s heaven, and my heaven s claim. luc. all this my sister is, or else should be. 65 ant. s. call thyself sister, sweet, for i am thee. thee will i love, and with thee lead my life: thou hast no husband yet, nor i no wife. give me thy hand. luc. o, soft, sir! hold you still: i ll fetch my sister, to get her good will. exit.

thou art 75 thyself. dro. s. i am an ass, i am a woman s man, and besides myself. ant. s. what woman s man? and how besides thyself? dro. s. marry, sir, besides myself, i am due to a 80 woman; one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me. ant. s. what claim lays she to thee? dro. s. marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, 85 i being a beast, she would have me; but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me. ant. s. what is she? dro. s. a very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may not speak of, without he say sir-reverence. i have 90 but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage. ant. s. how dost thou mean a fat marriage? dro. s. marry, sir, she s the kitchen-wench, and all grease; and i know not what use to put her to, but to make 95 a lamp of her, and run from her by her own light. i warrant, her rags, and the tallow in them, will burn a poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, she ll burn a week longer than the whole world. ant. s. what complexion is she of? 100 dro. s. swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept: for why she sweats; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it. ant. s. that s a fault that water will mend. dro. s. no, sir, tis in grain; noah s flood could not 105 do it. ant. s. what s her name? dro. s. nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that s an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip. 110 ant. s. then she bears some breadth? dro. s. no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; i could find out countries in her. ant. s. in what part of her body stands ireland? 115 dro. s. marry, sir, in her buttocks: i found it out by the bogs. ant. s. where scotland? dro. s. i found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand. 120 ant. s. where france? dro. s. in her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her heir. ant. s. where england? dro. s. i looked for the chalky cliffs, but i could find 125 no whiteness in them; but i guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between france and it. ant. s. where spain? dro. s. faith, i saw it not; but i felt it hot in her breath. 130 ant. s. where america, the indies? dro. s. oh, sir, upon her nose, all o er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose. 135 ant. s. where stood belgia, the netherlands? dro. s. oh, sir, i did not look so low. to conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me; called me dromio; swore i was assured to her; told me what privy marks i had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the 140 mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that i, amazed, ran from her as a witch: and, i think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, she had transform d me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i the wheel. ant. s. go hie thee presently, post to the road:-- 145 an if the wind blow any way from shore, i will not harbour in this town to-night:-- if any bark put forth, come to the mart, where i will walk till thou return to me. if every one knows us, and we know none, 150 tis time, i think, to trudge, pack, and be gone. dro. s. as from a bear a man would run for life, so fly i from her that would be my wife. exit. ant. s. there s none but witches do inhabit here; and therefore tis high time that i were hence. 155 she that doth call me husband, even my soul doth for a wife abhor. but her fair sister, possess d with such a gentle sovereign grace, of such enchanting presence and discourse, hath almost made me traitor to myself: 160 but, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, i ll

me, sir! i bespoke it not. ang. not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have. 170 go home with it, and please your wife withal; and soon at supper-time i ll visit you, and then receive my money for

cannot tell: but this i think, there s no man is so vain that would refuse so fair an offer d chain. i see a man here needs not live by shifts, 180 when in the streets he meets such golden gifts. i ll

nay, worse; a fellow all in buff; a back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands the passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; a hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well; one that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell. 40 adr. why, man, what is the matter? dro. s. i do not know the matter: he is rested on the case. adr. what, is he arrested? tell me at whose

that went, like a 20 base-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike. 25 ant. s. what, thou meanest an officer? dro. s. ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says, god give you good rest! 30 ant. s. well, sir, there rest in your foolery. is there any ship puts forth to-night? may we be gone? dro. s. why, sir, i brought you word an hour since, that the bark expedition put forth to-night; and then were you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy delay. 35 here are the

his own doors being shut against his entrance. belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, 85 on purpose shut the doors against his way. my way is now to his home to his house, and tell his wife that, being lunatic, he rush d into my house, and took perforce my ring away. this course i fittest choose; 90 for forty ducats is too much to lose. exit. notes: iv, 3. scene iii. scene v. pope. 13: what,

friend? hath not else his eye 50 stray d his affection in unlawful love? a sin prevailing much in youthful men, who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. which of these sorrows is he subject to? adr.

board, he fed not for my urging it; alone, it was the subject of my theme; 65 in company i often glanced it; still did i tell him it was vile and bad. abb. and thereof came it that the man was mad:-- the venom clamours of a jealous woman, poisons more deadly than a mad dog s tooth. 70 it seems his sleeps were hinder d by thy railing: and thereof comes it that his head is light. thou say st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings: unquiet meals make ill digestions; thereof the raging fire of fever bred; 75 and what s a fever but a fit of madness? thou say st his sports were hinder d by thy brawls: sweet recreation barr d, what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy, kinsman to grim and comfortless despair; 80 and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life? in food, in sport, and life-preserving rest to be disturb d, would mad or man or beast: the consequence is, then, thy jealous fits 85 have scared thy husband from the use of wits. luc. she never

till i have brought him to his wits again, or lose my labour in assaying it. adr. i will attend my husband, be his nurse, diet his sickness, for it is my office, and will have no attorney but myself; 100 and therefore let me have him home with me. abb. be patient; for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have, with wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers, to make of him a formal man again: 105 it is a branch and parcel of mine oath, a charitable duty of my order. therefore depart, and leave him here with me. adr. i will not hence, and leave my husband here: and ill it

prostrate at his feet, and never rise until my tears and prayers 115 have won his grace to come in person hither, and take perforce my husband from the abbess. sec. mer. by this, i think, the dial points at five: anon, i m sure, the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale, 120 the place of death and sorry execution, behind the ditches of the abbey here. ang. upon what cause? sec. mer. to see a reverend syracusian merchant, who put unluckily into this bay 125 against the laws and statutes of this town, beheaded publicly for his offence. ang. see where they come: we will behold his death. luc. kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey. enter duke, attended; geon bareheaded; with the headsman and other officers . duke. yet once again proclaim it publicly, 130 if any friend will pay the sum for him, he shall not die; so much we tender him. adr. justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess! duke. she is a virtuous and a reverend lady: it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong. 135 adr. may it please your grace, antipholus my husband,-- whom i made lord of me and all i had, at your important letters,--this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him; that desperately he hurried through the street,-- 140 with him his bondman, all as mad as he,-- doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses, bearing thence rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. once did i get him bound, and sent him home, 145 whilst to take order for the wrongs i went, that here and there his fury had committed. anon, i wot not by what strong escape, he broke from those that had the guard of him; and with his mad attendant and himself, 150 each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, met us again, and, madly bent on us, chased us away; till, raising of more aid, we came again to bind them. then they fled into this abbey, whither we pursued them; 155 and here the abbess shuts the gates on us, and will not suffer us to fetch him out, nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence. therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help. 160 duke. long since thy husband served me in my wars; and i to thee engaged a prince s word, when thou didst make him master of thy bed, to do him all the grace and good i could. go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate, 165 and bid the lady abbess come to me. i will determine this before i stir. enter a servant . serv. o mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself! my master and his man are both broke loose, beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor, 170 whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire; and ever, as it blazed, they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair: my master preaches patience to him, and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool; 175 and sure, unless you send some present help, between them they will kill the conjurer. adr. peace, fool! thy master and his man are here; and that is false thou dost report to us. serv. mistress, upon my life, i tell you true; 180 i have not breathed almost since i did see it. he cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, to scorch your face and to disfigure you. cry within. hark, hark! i hear him, mistress: fly, be gone! duke. come, stand by me; fear nothing. guard with halberds! 185 adr. ay me, it is my husband! witness you, that he is borne about invisible: even now we housed him in the abbey here; and now he s there, past thought of human reason. enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus . ant. e. justice, most gracious duke, o, grant me justice! 190 even for the service that long since i did thee, when i bestrid thee in the wars, and took deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood that then i lost for thee, now grant me justice. ge. unless the fear of death doth make me dote, 195 i see my son antipholus, and dromio. ant. e. justice, sweet prince, against that woman there! she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife, that hath abused and dishonour d me even in the strength and height of injury: 200 beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me. duke. discover how, and thou shalt find me just. ant. e. this day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me, while she with harlots feasted in my house. 205 duke. a grievous fault! say, woman, didst thou so? adr. no, my good lord: myself, he and my sister to-day did dine together. so befal my soul as this is false he burdens me withal! luc. ne er may i look on day, nor sleep on night, 210 but she tells to your highness simple truth! ang. o perjured woman! they are both forsworn: in this the madman justly chargeth them. ant. e. my liege, i am advised what i say; neither disturbed with the effect of wine, 215 nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. this woman lock d me out this day from dinner: that goldsmith there, were he not pack d with her, could witness it, for he was with me then; 220 who parted with me to go fetch a chain, promising to bring it to the porpentine, where balthazar and i did dine together. our dinner done, and he not coming thither, i went to seek him: in the street i met him, 225 and in his company that gentleman. there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain, which, god he knows, i saw not: for the which he did arrest me with an officer. 230 i did obey; and sent my peasant home for certain ducats: he with none return d. then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house. by the way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more 235 of vile confederates. along with them they brought one pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, a mere anatomy, a mountebank, a threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller, a needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, 240 a living-dead man: this pernicious slave, forsooth, took on him as a conjurer; and, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, and with no face, as twere, outfacing me, cries out, i was possess d. then all together 245 they fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man, both bound together; till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, i gain d my freedom, and immediately 250 ran hither to your grace; whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities. ang. my lord, in truth, thus far i witness with him, that he dined not at home, but was lock d out. 255 duke. but had he such a chain of thee or no? ang. he had, my lord: and when he ran in here, these people saw the chain about his neck. sec. mer. besides, i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him, 260 after you first forswore it on the mart: and thereupon i drew my sword on you; and then you fled into this abbey here, from whence, i think, you are come by miracle. ant. e. i never came within these abbey-walls; 265 nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: i never saw the chain, so help me heaven: and this is false you burden me withal! duke. why, what an intricate impeach is this! i think you all have drunk of circe s cup. 270 if here you housed him, here he would have been; if he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: you say he dined at home; the goldsmith here denies that saying. sirrah, what say you? dro. e. sir, he dined with her there, at the porpentine. 275 cour. he did; and from my finger snatch d that ring. ant. e. tis true, my liege; this ring i had of her. duke. saw st thou him enter at the abbey here? cour. as sure, my liege, as i do see your grace. duke. why, this is strange. go call the abbess hither. 280 i think you are all mated, or stark mad. exit one to the abbess. ge. most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: haply i see a friend will save my life, and pay the sum that may deliver me. duke. speak freely, syracusian, what thou wilt. 285 ge. is not your name, sir, call d antipholus? and is not that your bondman, dromio? dro. e. within this hour i was his bondman, sir, but he, i thank him, gnaw d in two my cords: now am i dromio, and his man unbound. 290 ge. i am sure you both of you remember me. dro. e. ourselves we do remember, sir, by you; for lately we were bound, as you are now. you are not pinch s patient, are you, sir? ge. why look you strange on me? you know me well. 295 ant. e. i never saw you in my life till now. ge. o, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, and careful hours with time s deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face: but tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? 300 ant. e. neither. ge. dromio, nor thou? dro. e. no, trust me, sir, nor i. ge. i am sure thou dost. dro. e. ay, sir, but i am sure i do not; and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him. 305 ge. not know my voice! o time s extremity, hast thou so crack d and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years, that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? though now this grained face of mine be hid 310 in sap-consuming winter s drizzled snow, and all the conduits of my blood froze up, yet hath my night of life some memory, my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, my dull deaf ears a little use to hear: 315 all these old witnesses--i cannot err-- tell me thou art my son antipholus. ant. e. i never saw my father in my life. ge. but seven years since, in syracusa, boy, thou know st we parted: but perhaps, my son, 320 thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery. ant. e. the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so: i ne er saw syracusa in my life. duke. i tell thee, syracusian, twenty years 325 have i been patron to antipholus, during which time he ne er saw syracusa: i see thy age and dangers make thee dote. re-enter abbess , with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse . abb. most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong d. all gather to see them. adr. i see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me. 330 duke. one of these men is genius to the other; and so of these. which is the natural man, and which the spirit? who deciphers them? dro. s. i, sir, am dromio: command him away. dro. e. i, sir, am dromio: pray, let me stay. 335 ant. s. geon art thou not? or else his ghost? dro. s. o, my old master! who hath bound him here? abb. whoever bound him, i will loose his bonds, and gain a husband by his liberty. speak, old geon, if thou be st the man 340 that hadst a wife once call d milia, that bore thee at a burden two fair sons: o, if thou be st the same geon, speak, and speak unto the same milia! ge. if i dream not, thou art milia: 345 if thou art she, tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft? abb. by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio, all were taken up; but by and by rude fishermen of corinth 350 by force took dromio and my son from them, and me they left with those of epidamnum. what then became of them i cannot tell; i to this fortune that you see me in. duke. why, here begins his morning story right: 355 these two antipholuses, these two so like, and these two dromios, one in semblance,-- besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- these are the parents to these children, which accidentally are met together. 360 antipholus, thou camest from corinth first? ant. s. no, sir, not i; i came from syracuse. duke. stay, stand apart; i know not which is which. ant. e. i came from corinth, my most gracious lord,-- dro. e. and i with him. 365 ant. e. brought to this town by that most famous warrior. duke menaphon, your most renowned uncle. adr. which of you two did dine with me to-day? ant. s. i, gentle mistress. adr. and are not you my husband? ant. e. no; i say nay to that. 370 ant. s. and so do i; yet did she call me so: and this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, did call me brother. to lucia. what i told you then, i hope i shall have leisure to make good; if this be not a dream i see and hear. 375 ang. that is the chain, sir, which you had of me. ant. s. i think it be, sir; i deny it not. ant. e. and you, sir, for this chain arrested me. ang. i think i did, sir; i deny it not. adr. i sent you money, sir, to be your bail, 380 by dromio; but i think he brought it not. dro. e. no, none by me. ant. s. this purse of ducats i received from you, and dromio my man did bring them me. i see we still did meet each other s man; 385 and i was ta en for him, and he for me; and thereupon these errors are arose. ant. e. these ducats pawn i for my father here. duke. it shall not need; thy father hath his life. cour. sir, i must have that diamond from you. 390 ant. e. there, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer. abb. renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here, and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;-- and all that are assembled in this place, 395 that by this sympathized one day s error have suffer d wrong, go keep us company, and we shall make full satisfaction.-- thirty-three years have i but gone in travail of you, my sons; and till this present hour 400 my heavy burthen ne er delivered. the duke, my husband, and my children both, and you the calendars of their nativity, go to a gossips feast, and go with me; after so long grief, such nativity! 405 duke. with all my heart, i ll gossip at this feast. exeunt all but ant. s., ant. e., dro. s., and dro. e. dro. s. master, shall i fetch your stuff from ship-board? ant. e. dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark d? dro. s. your goods that lay at host, sir, in the centaur. ant. s. he speaks to me. --i am your master, dromio: 410 come, go with us; we ll look to that anon: embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him. exeunt ant. s. and ant. e. dro. s. there is a fat friend at your master s house, that kitchen d me for you to-day at dinner: she now shall be my sister, not my wife. 415 dro. e. methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: i see by you i am a sweet-faced youth. will you walk in to see their gossiping? dro. s. not i, sir; you are my elder. dro. e. that s a question: how shall we try it? 420 dro. s. we ll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first. dro. e. nay, then, thus:-- we came into the world like brother and brother; and now let s go hand in hand, not one before another. exeunt. notes: v, 1. scene i. a street ...

embracing. rowe. notes. note i. in the spelling of the name of solinus we have followed the first folio. in the subsequent folios it was altered, most probably by an accident in f2 to salinus. the name occurs only once in the copies, and that in the first line of the text. the name which we have given as antipholus is spelt indifferently thus, and antipholis in the folios. it will hardly be doubted that the lines in the rhyming passage, iii. 2. 2, 4, where the folios read antipholus, are correctly amended by capell, and prove that antipholus is the spelling of shakespeare. either word is evidently corrupted from antiphilus. these names are merely arbitrary, but the surnames, erotes and sereptus, are most probably errors for errans, or erraticus and surreptus, of which the latter is plainly derived from plautus men chmus surreptus , a well-known character in shakespeare s day: see brian melbancke s philotimus 1582 , p. 160: thou art like menechmus subreptus his wife ... whose husband shall not neede to be justice of peace for she will have a charter to make her justice of coram. see merry wives , i. 1. 4, 5. in spelling syracusian instead of syracusan we follow the practice of the folios in an indifferent matter. epidamnum not epidamium is found in the english translation of the men chmi , 1595, so the latter form in f1 is probably a printer s error. note ii. i. 2. 1. that this scene is laid at the mart appears from antipholus s allusion to this place in ii. 2. 5, 6: i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart. as this play is derived from a classical prototype, capell has supposed no change of scene, but lays the whole action in a publick place; evidently with much inconvenience to the persons. note iii. ii. 1. 30. johnson s ingenious conjecture may have been suggested to him by a passage in as you like it , iv. 3. 17: her love is not the hare that i do hunt. but the received reading of the folios is perhaps confirmed by a line in the present play, iii. 2. 7: or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth. note iv. ii. 1. 108 sqq. the only correction of this passage which we believe to be quite free from doubt is that in line 112, wear for where. accordingly, with this exception, we have retained the precise words of the first folio. note v. iv. 2. 38. grey s conjecture of lanes for lands is made somewhat more probable by the existence of copies of f1 in which the word appears lans. a corrector would naturally change this rather to lands than to lanes, because of the rhyme. note vi. iv. 2. 46. the folios have send him mistris redemption, and rowe, by his punctuation and capital r, made dromio call luciana redemption. pope and theobald seem to have followed him, though they give the small r. the folios cannot be made chargeable with this error, for the comma does not regularly follow vocatives in these editions where we expect it. there is no comma, for instance, following the word mistress in iv. 3. 75 or in iv. 4. 39. note vii. iv. 4. 29. the word ears might probably be better printed ears for years; for a pun--hitherto, however, unnoticed--seems to be indicated by the following words. a very farfetched explanation has been offered by steevens, and accepted by delius and, we believe, by all the modern editors, namely, that antipholus has wrung dromio s ears so often that they have attained a length like an ass s. note viii. v. 1. 1. shakespeare uses the words priory and abbey as synonymous. compare v. 1. 37 and v. 1. 122. note ix. v. 1. 235. it might possibly be better to print this line as two lines, the first being broken: by the way we met my wife.... but the place is probably corrupt. note x. v. 1. 399. the number thirty-three has been altered by editors to bring the figures into harmony with other periods named in the play. from i. 1. 126, 133 the age of antipholus has been computed at twenty-three; from i. 1. 126 and v. 1. 308 we derive twenty-five. the duke says he has been patron to antipholus for twenty years, v. 1. 325; but three or five seems too small an age to assign for the commencement of this patronage. antipholus saved the duke s life in the wars long since, v. 1. 161, 191. his long experience of his wife s wisdom and her years are mentioned, iii. 1. 89, 90. but shakespeare probably did not compute the result of his own figures with any great care or accuracy. sources: the editors preface e-text 23041 discusses the 17th- and 18th-century editions in detail; the newer 19th-century editions are simply listed by name. the following editions may

    "# Problem one: While I was able to run my code before I forked the repository, \n",

    "# keep saying that no module named nltk was found. \n",

    "# Crafted prompts 1: It took me five prompts to get to the solution. \n",
    "# I first sent a screenshot of the error message I was getting which says\n",
    "# \"no module nltk found\", and asked copilot how to fix it. Copilot suggested that I install nltk using pip. I followed the \n",
    "# the suggestion, and piped install nltk in the terminal. However, in when \n",
    "# I installed the package, I got a message that said \"Requirement already satisfied\".\n",
    "# I was very confused, so I sent another prompt asking \"what could be wrong?\"\n",
    "# if nltk was already installed. Copilot suggested that I checked my python\n",
    "# environment, and make sure that I was using the same environment where nltk was located. \n",
    "# Copilot gave me an option to check my nltk installation by running \"pip show nltk\" \n",
    "# in the terminal and check the location of the package in jupyter notebook by running \n",
    "# import sysprint(sys.executable) and !{sys.executable} -m pip install nltk. The locations \n",
    "# did not match. I decided to run the \"python -m pip install nltk\" in the console\n",
    "# instead of the terminal and that fixed the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Review and verify(1): Copilot gave me different options and \n",
    "# I usually started with the simplest one first, usually the first or \n",
    "# second suggestion. In this case, it takes three prompts to get to the solution. \n",

    "# The process: Even though installing nltk does not seem hard, \n",
    "# because it only takes one command to install it, not being able to get \n",
    "# it to work was very confusing. Thankfully, copilot was able to guide me, giving \n",
    "# me a different suggestions based on my comfort level. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem two: When comparing two pieces of texts from the Gutenburg prohect, \n",
    "# I felt like my code was very repetitive and long. I somewhat have an idea on how \n",
    "# to work with one text, but did not know how to extend the code to work with \n",
    "# more than two texts or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Crafted prompts #2: \n",
    "# 1) I started by sending copilot my existing code that works with one text, \n",
    "# and asked \"how do I clean and process two texts at the same time?\" \n",
    "# 2) While I was normalizing the unicode, I got an error message \n",

    "# including the screenshot of the error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Review and verify(2): \n",
    "# 1) Copilot suggested that I could create a function that takes in a text as \n",
    "# input and returns the cleaned and processed text. I know we covered this in\n",
    "# class, so I incorporated the function into my code. It made my code so much more \n",
    "# concise and easier to read. \n",
    "# 2) Copilot pointed out that I made a type in the normalization \n",
